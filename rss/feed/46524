      <description>Other than these small nitpicks below : I love it !!!&#13;
&#13;
About the installation procedure : &#13;
========================&#13;
&#13;
 - Fix the tarball top-level directory name : extensions --&gt; extension&#13;
&#13;
 - Propose a default ImportNodeID that is present in a stock eZ Publish Community Project webin/ezflow installation&#13;
&#13;
 - Mention in step #4 of the README / installation process that the instagram.ini[instagram]RedirectURI directive must be modified too&#13;
&#13;
 - Step #6 should be placed after step #10 (some might run the cronjob by reading step#6, even if it is only explicitly mentioned in step #10 - just to avoid PEBKAC issues)&#13;
&#13;
 - Add logging capability for pictures import --&gt; useful to troubleshoot when relying on external services, the raliability of which might break the system.&#13;
&#13;
 - The default tags should be commented-out I think. Upon the first sync with eZ Publish, all photos of the instagr.am feed are tagged automatically. I am still not sure about this one. The fun effect is that it got me 85 likes in 3 minutes (while I barely have 20 pictures :) ). Or maybe just make the tags a bit more generic ? (ex: removing 'iphone4' ? ).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Usages I can picture : &#13;
================&#13;
 - Instagram pictures roll on a blog landing-page,&#13;
&#13;
 - Sync of Instagram comments and comments under the picture in eZ Publish : merging web commenting and in-app mobile commenting : the social fusion,&#13;
&#13;
 - Publishing to Instagr.am from eZ Publish, with link to eZ Publish article as comment under the instagram post (for bloggers, brand ambassadors reviewing products, journalists, reporters, etc...)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Keep-up Florian and thanks for this very cool contribution !</description>
