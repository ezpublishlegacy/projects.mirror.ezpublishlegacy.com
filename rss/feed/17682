      <description>I second the fact that discussions in there should only relate to ezpedia content.&#13;
They should imho also be visually better identified as not being articles per-se, but comments relating to a given article...</description>

      <description>Nice Heath!&#13;
&#13;
Comments:&#13;
1. I wouldn't add description attribute if it isn't already there, maybe a operator to get first paragraph using a simple DOMDocument-&gt;getElementsByTagName call, but not really needed.&#13;
&#13;
2. Seems like a general discussion is going on in there*, that could work if we had one big syndicated community site that pulled in discussions from several sites. But until then I think general discussions should be on ez.no/developer, leaving only article / ezpedia.org discussions in there*.&#13;

      <description>@ André R.&#13;
&#13;
Thank you Andre!&#13;
&#13;
Per your request I have made the following modifications.&#13;
&#13;
1. Linked to the forum topic in the forum template (this way the discussion menu link remains displayed even when within the forum / forum topic). &#13;
&#13;
2. Description ... I'm considering your request for a description / intro of the wiki entry. I'm not sure how best to implement offhand since the wiki articles do not have a short description  / intro field within the entry.&#13;
&#13;
For now I added a link within the forum template to display the name of the wiki article with return link.&#13;
&#13;
3. Thread message display order - I have also reversed the default order to display messages (as most recent) first to help avoid unnecessary scrolling or pagination and improve usability.&#13;
&#13;
4. Latest updates rss feed - I have added an rss feed with only the latest updated conteent objects on ezpedia. http://ezpedia.org/rss/updated/discussion&#13;
&#13;
5. Latest discussion (only) updates rss feed - I have added an rss feed with only the latest updated content objects on ezpedia. http://ezpedia.org/rss/updated/discussion&#13;
&#13;
6. Homepage - Layout - I have also added a list of recent discussions into the homepage layout. http://ezpedia.org/&#13;
&#13;
Take a look at the changes and let me know what you think.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <description>Nice. But would be slightly better with the following small enhancements:&#13;
* Link to the topic in the forum / forum topic template, if possible also the description / intro of the wiki entry (if this is used).&#13;
* make the left menu about the entry, even when you browse the forum underneath it.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#13;
&#13;
I found an example of the eZpedia&#13;
discussion system that was created&#13;
but not &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; used.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;i&gt;http://ezpedia.org/en/ez/cache/discussion/improving_example_documentation_of_how_to_clear_cache_why_and_when&lt;/i&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Today is a great time to start new conversations!&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <description>ezpedia.org is willing to collaborate on this. In the past the idea was to have a forum under each page, allowing for people to start any discussions regarding that page. I am not sure this is the best way to continue, but I believe it's certainly better than one discussion page.&#13;
&#13;
Please be aware that ezpedia.org is independant and not a project lead by eZ Systems, so we (the independant eZ open source community) will have the final call on what is done there.</description>

      <description>Sure, I just saw a need to have a place to discuss doc and if possible organize people who are interested in contributing. Svn was just added since you get it anyway with projects.&#13;
&#13;
Comments are are not a good way to discuss, only to add remarks on doc page / articles.&#13;
ezpedia does not have any collaboration features as far as I know.&#13;
But yes, this could have been solved with a separate doc forum on ez.no, and just use ezpedia for stub articles / work in progress pages.</description>

      <title>Is this the best medium for the job?</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/doc/forum/general/is_this_the_best_medium_for_the_job</link>
      <description>I applaud the concept of community documentation - for years, comments have been added to the online documentation providing information not within the docs; and community members are more likely to provide documentation, as an easy way to give back to the community (see forums).&#13;
&#13;
However, I don't think forums + SVN /docs are the best way to contribute.  I think a wiki + discussions would serve the online community better, and could inform the official documentation.&#13;
&#13;
Your thoughts?</description>
