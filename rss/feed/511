      <title>Mirror of entire membership extension repository on GitHub!</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/membership2/forum/general/mirror_of_entire_membership_extension_repository_on_github</link>
      <description>Hello eZ Community using membership extension!&#13;
&#13;
Brookins Consulting is happy to announce we have created a full and complete import of the entire project's svn repository into a git based repository on GitHub.&#13;
&#13;
https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/membership&#13;
&#13;
We will strive to keep this friendly fork / mirror up to date with any changes that come in the future from the forums and other forks in an effort to remain compatible with the latest versions of eZ Publish.&#13;
&#13;
Anyone is free to use (clone) this repository, just watch it for changes, or fork this new repository and use it as needed freely. This is a friendly mirror of the extension.&#13;
&#13;
Currently the latest version provided by the mirror is r13 | nfrp | 2010-11-30 10:45:06 -0600 (Tue, 30 Nov 2010).&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;
Brookins Consulting&#13;

      <title>Does not work :/</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/membership2/forum/general/does_not_work</link>
      <description>Hi,&#13;
&#13;
I've read the documentation given. The interesting part for me is "4.3 Membership Workflows".&#13;
I just would like to do a simple thing : approve new members.&#13;
I create a new worflow "approve membership", then I choose it in the membership/register/before in Triggers.&#13;
I apply and clear caches.&#13;
&#13;
But, when I test it, I just try to register myself, and straight after I am a member, whitout being approved by me (admin).&#13;
I don't have the message "... is now waiting for approval..", neither approval email, neither a message in collaboration/group/inbox as Admin user in admin site, the approval request is not displayed.&#13;
&#13;
Thank you for any help !</description>
