      <description>Hi,&#13;
&#13;
copy the .swf file and the skin file to your own domain, because there are sometimes troubles by using different domains and change the settings in the jwplayer.ini. Enter the URL to your video instead of "Play".&#13;
&#13;
In the newer version of this player you will be able to create playlists and more filetypes are supported. I hope to release it in the next few weeks.&#13;

      <description>This looks like a good extension. I am having problems using it though. &#13;
&#13;
I am using Ez Publish 4.0.0&#13;
&#13;
I uploaded the FLV file to the media section of the site.&#13;
&#13;
Then I edit the Description XML block on the page I want the video to appear.&#13;
&#13;
I click the "Insert Custom Tag" button in the editor. &#13;
&#13;
In the popup window I select "jwplayer" as the custom tag.&#13;
&#13;
I then enter "Play" in the Text field, "" in the Type field, and "Standard" in the Player Class field. I then press ok&#13;
&#13;
This then generates the text:&#13;
&#13;
&lt;custom name="jwplayer" custom:type="custom" custom:playerclass="Standard"&gt;Play&lt;/custom&gt;&#13;
&#13;
I then send it for publishing.&#13;
&#13;
In the page that then loads I have the following text:&#13;
&#13;
&lt;a href='javascript:JWPlayer.play("Play", "http://nocache.all2e.com/var/plain_site/storage/original/video/player.swf", {width: "720",height:"450",autostart:"true",fullscreen:"false",skin:"http://nocache.all2e.com/var/plain_site/storage/original/video/schoon.swf",bgcolor:"#cccccc"})'&gt;Play&lt;/a&gt;&#13;
&#13;
I can't see where to add the location of my own video, and the editor won't allow me to use javascript in an XML block.&#13;
&#13;
How do I get this extension to play my own video?&#13;

      <description>Hi, Markus Bader. I very like the extension. Could you give me the .fla file of the swf player so I can create new looks of the player? Or, maybe you can tell me how to create new flash player for it. Thanks.&#13;

      <description>Hi Florian,&#13;
&#13;
on eZ Projects it is common to use svn to download the extenstions. Therefore you have to install a svn client (on Windows Tortoise SVN is common) and do a checkout. You can find the SVN adress in the title menu under 'Subversion' ( http://projects.ez.no/all2ejwplayer/subversion ).&#13;
&#13;
Please remember this extenstion is a beta, so it might cause problems and we do not have an installation guide yet.&#13;

      <description>Hello everyone,&#13;
&#13;
I am a new user of ezpublish and I am looking for a solution to read flv video by streaming. If I can use it, I think that the all2ejwplayer project could help me a lot to solve this problem. Unfortunately, I don't know how to try it, if it is possible. Someone told me I had to download a packaged version of the code, but I didn't find any. As this project seems to be quite new, I thought that maybe a packaged version will be published in the next couple of week, but I didn't find any information about that. Could someone give me some guidance about that ?&#13;
&#13;
Thank you very much for your help.&#13;
&#13;
