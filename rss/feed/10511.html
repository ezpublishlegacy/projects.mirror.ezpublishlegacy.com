      <description>Well, I guess it would be possible, but you would need one expirer object per user... a tad too much imho. There is no reason why this doesn't work.&#13;

What exact version of eZ publish ?</description>

      <title>Will it work also when modifying users?</title>

      <description>When I tried to have a cache block tied to the users subtree, I found out it did not expire correctly when a user profile (as in: content object) was modified.&#13;
Since I was showing the user's pictogram in the global pagelayout menu, I had to resort to expire that cache block every 5 minutes, so that if a user changed his picture, he would see it after a while. Not perfect, but acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
What I really crave for is a way to expire a cache block on demand, the same as the cache for a node can be expired. It would be good if eg. we could have a function that expires a cache block given its cache key. So it would be easy to create eg cache key such as concat('user_', $user.userid) and expire it when you know the user has changed - not all stored versions of this cache block, but only the specific one tied to the given user id...&#13;
