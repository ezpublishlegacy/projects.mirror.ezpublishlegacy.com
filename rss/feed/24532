      <title>ezpaypal using cURL</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/ezpaypal/forum/general/ezpaypal_using_curl</link>
      <description>I have created  an eZ paypal variation that uses cURL instead of socket to check payment, this was due to some problems I found on some servers that doesn't allow socket external communication, also I made some more small additions.&#13;
&#13;
As everybody knows the web shop feature was deprecated since ez 4.3, but it still does work as in ezcommunity 2012.4, so I added the necessary ini settings to show shop menu in admin interface.&#13;
&#13;
Also I added a small installation tutorial, some hints/tips on how to setup the paypal sandbox enviroment, and a note on localhost testing.&#13;
&#13;
Please check, fork, and contribute to the extension on Github.&#13;
&#13;
I would like to expand this extension and include the payperdownload tutorial and some things more like subscriptions or pay per content tree node access, so... I do accept commits ;D&#13;
