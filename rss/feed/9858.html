      <title>Re: File Structure in SVN</title>

      <description>Hi Donat&#13;
&#13;
Thanks for checking things out.&#13;
&#13;
I've finally got around to having a look at those files and worked out what they were.  I started this project because I had to override a bunch of datatype templates to get the required output.  The "done" templates were these original files and formed the basis for ththe extension.&#13;
&#13;
The templates that are part of the extension and detailed the the CHANGELOG are the ones the the correct directory and will be included when the extension is enabled.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers&#13;

      <title>File Structure in SVN</title>

      <description>Hi Bruce&#13;
&#13;
thanks for this initiative! It will be a tedious task and I am glad you have started it.&#13;
&#13;
One suggestion: please keep the file structure in SVN as it would be in the extension. Obviousely you have put the already overhauled templates in a subfolder "done". I'd suggest that you have only the modified templates in SVN.&#13;
&#13;
Regards&#13;
