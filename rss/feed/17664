      <description>I second the fact that discussions in there should only relate to ezpedia content.&#13;
They should imho also be visually better identified as not being articles per-se, but comments relating to a given article...</description>

      <description>Nice Heath!&#13;
&#13;
Comments:&#13;
1. I wouldn't add description attribute if it isn't already there, maybe a operator to get first paragraph using a simple DOMDocument-&gt;getElementsByTagName call, but not really needed.&#13;
&#13;
2. Seems like a general discussion is going on in there*, that could work if we had one big syndicated community site that pulled in discussions from several sites. But until then I think general discussions should be on ez.no/developer, leaving only article / ezpedia.org discussions in there*.&#13;

      <description>@ André R.&#13;
&#13;
Thank you Andre!&#13;
&#13;
Per your request I have made the following modifications.&#13;
&#13;
1. Linked to the forum topic in the forum template (this way the discussion menu link remains displayed even when within the forum / forum topic). &#13;
&#13;
2. Description ... I'm considering your request for a description / intro of the wiki entry. I'm not sure how best to implement offhand since the wiki articles do not have a short description  / intro field within the entry.&#13;
&#13;
For now I added a link within the forum template to display the name of the wiki article with return link.&#13;
&#13;
3. Thread message display order - I have also reversed the default order to display messages (as most recent) first to help avoid unnecessary scrolling or pagination and improve usability.&#13;
&#13;
4. Latest updates rss feed - I have added an rss feed with only the latest updated conteent objects on ezpedia. http://ezpedia.org/rss/updated/discussion&#13;
&#13;
5. Latest discussion (only) updates rss feed - I have added an rss feed with only the latest updated content objects on ezpedia. http://ezpedia.org/rss/updated/discussion&#13;
&#13;
6. Homepage - Layout - I have also added a list of recent discussions into the homepage layout. http://ezpedia.org/&#13;
&#13;
Take a look at the changes and let me know what you think.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <title>Re: Workstation environments</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/doc/forum/article_suggestions/workstation_environments/re_workstation_environments2</link>
      <description>That's fantastic, André. I use both OS X and XP. On the OS X side, I usually have trouble with the dependencies (ImageMagick, ensuring the correct version of Apache is installed, etc.). I know MAMP can alleviate some of this but I ran into conflicts with the few times I tried it.&#13;
&#13;
I've used XAMPP on the Windows side but never with eZ. Perhaps it's time to give it a try.&#13;
&#13;
Like I said in the OP, I know most of this is possible, it's just organizing the information in a central area.</description>

      <title>Re: Workstation environments</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/doc/forum/article_suggestions/workstation_environments/re_workstation_environments</link>
      <description>There are generally three camps, the gnu ones that have been on *nix all along and never will give up emac/vim, the mac os users that either came from windows or *nix and use TextMate + mamp mostly, and the Windows users that are used to Visual Studio and tend to migrate to Eclipse.&#13;
&#13;
So I guess this proposed doc will need three routes.&#13;
&#13;
Since I'm a Windows user myself I'll roughly outline the setup routine I go through:&#13;
1. Install wampserver* if you need to easily switch php versions between different projects or alternatively use the bitnami based eZ Publish installer** if you don't.&#13;
2. Install eclipse + pdt bundle (latest is 3.5 + 2.1) so you get code completion and other visual features in php&#13;
3. Install subclipse OR subversive to handle svn inside eclipse&#13;
4. [Optionally] Setup xdebug or zend debugger, both can give you php stack traces on errors and can be used for profiling, integrations with eclipse is also possible, search;)&#13;
4. [Optionally] If you have iis on the machine as well, then you need to reconfigure apache if you installed wamp, to use different port number, for instance 81(Think it was the 'Listen' directive, the cof file should be fairly good documented, so just open it using wamp tray icon -&gt; apache -&gt; configuration)&#13;
5. [Optionally] setup eclipse to use wamp's www folder as working directory, this way, you don't have to create virtual hosts for all new projects, but can browse them by accessing http://localhost[:81]/&lt;projectname&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Alternatively, you could try Zend Studio + Zend Core, witch will result in somewhat the same thing, but already setup for you, and maybe a bit slicker and better integrated, but I haven't tried it so don't really know.&#13;
&#13;
Note: there is one down side to Eclipse, its fairly slow.. Unless you are on Linux, so if you have a slow computer, then setting up the above(expect wamp, use package manager for things like that) on for instance Ubuntu instead would make a big difference for Eclipse and eZ Publish responsiveness!&#13;
&#13;
* http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php&#13;
(note, PHP 5.3 is not fully tested yet, and might contain regressions, so download PHP 5.2.8 from "Addons" if you are going to do serious development)&#13;

      <title>Workstation environments</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/doc/forum/article_suggestions/workstation_environments</link>
      <description>There are a lot of articles on server configuration, but we haven't found much on setting up an optimal dev environment. &#13;
&#13;
We're looking for information on IDEs, step debugging, etc. Many are making the jump from IIS/ASP .NET and Visual Studio to Apache/PHP5 and &lt;b&gt;[?]&lt;/b&gt;. I think the &lt;b&gt;[?]&lt;/b&gt; is the problem -- there are many IDEs and multiple versions of each IDE (ex. Eclipse). &#13;
&#13;
What IDEs/tools does eZ / the community use and how are they configured?</description>

      <description>André, yes. An object's storage and the methods that act upon it are require a fair amount of digging. Maybe its specific locations in the database tables aren't important for an article like this since they are encapsulated by the methods.</description>

      <description>So your talking about the life of the php eZ Object when it is requested?&#13;
Or also its life in the database from publish, request, translated, trashed/archived and deleted?</description>

      <description>Nice. But would be slightly better with the following small enhancements:&#13;
* Link to the topic in the forum / forum topic template, if possible also the description / intro of the wiki entry (if this is used).&#13;
* make the left menu about the entry, even when you browse the forum underneath it.</description>

      <description>Hello,&#13;
&#13;
I found an example of the eZpedia&#13;
discussion system that was created&#13;
but not &lt;i&gt;yet&lt;/i&gt; used.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;i&gt;http://ezpedia.org/en/ez/cache/discussion/improving_example_documentation_of_how_to_clear_cache_why_and_when&lt;/i&gt;&#13;

Today is a great time to start new conversations!&#13;

      <title>The life of an eZ object</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/doc/forum/article_suggestions/the_life_of_an_ez_object</link>
      <description>The books (http://ez.no/store/books) and technical documentation cover this, but we need a developer perspective.&#13;
&#13;
What about an article about creating an example object and showing where information about it is dispersed in the system and how other parts of the system interface with it.&#13;
&#13;
Possible areas of focus:&#13;
- When an object is requested.&#13;
- When/how the object is cached and what parts are cached.&#13;
- When search index information is updated and what triggers it.</description>

      <description>ezpedia.org is willing to collaborate on this. In the past the idea was to have a forum under each page, allowing for people to start any discussions regarding that page. I am not sure this is the best way to continue, but I believe it's certainly better than one discussion page.&#13;
&#13;
Please be aware that ezpedia.org is independant and not a project lead by eZ Systems, so we (the independant eZ open source community) will have the final call on what is done there.</description>

      <description>Sure, I just saw a need to have a place to discuss doc and if possible organize people who are interested in contributing. Svn was just added since you get it anyway with projects.&#13;
&#13;
Comments are are not a good way to discuss, only to add remarks on doc page / articles.&#13;
ezpedia does not have any collaboration features as far as I know.&#13;
But yes, this could have been solved with a separate doc forum on ez.no, and just use ezpedia for stub articles / work in progress pages.</description>

      <title>Is this the best medium for the job?</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/doc/forum/general/is_this_the_best_medium_for_the_job</link>
      <description>I applaud the concept of community documentation - for years, comments have been added to the online documentation providing information not within the docs; and community members are more likely to provide documentation, as an easy way to give back to the community (see forums).&#13;
&#13;
However, I don't think forums + SVN /docs are the best way to contribute.  I think a wiki + discussions would serve the online community better, and could inform the official documentation.&#13;
&#13;
Your thoughts?</description>

      <title>New Community Documentation initiative</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/doc/news/new_community_documentation_initiative</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
A new Community Documentation initiative has been started, the idea is to&lt;br /&gt;
better coordinate documentation efforts in the community for eZ Publish on&lt;br /&gt;
eZPedia.org, API, ez.no/doc, articles and future FAQ / Getting started section&lt;br /&gt;on upcoming community portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Based on feedback we have received from the eZ Community we see a &lt;br /&gt;strong demand for a documentation for new users. So this is your chance to really contribute and make a difference, no matter what your knowledge level is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
