      <title>Fantastic solution for all the eZ Publish Editors Worldwide!</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/ezautosave/reviews/fantastic_solution_for_all_the_ez_publish_editors_worldwide</link>
      <description>I think this extension is fantastic. I mean really amazing (so perfect, so simple and self contained).&#13;
&#13;
I've heard of many such requests for this exact solution over the years.&#13;
&#13;
The solution is well made, leverages ezoe features, ezjscore, jquery, the javascript code required is clean and very simple to understand, it's very impressive.&#13;
&#13;
This extension is so simple to use it made me laugh really hard. Just activate the extension and your ready to edit your content with the autosave! This means it's so simple to use right out of the box that any one even with minimal experience can use this solution within their eZ Publish website.&#13;
&#13;
Extra points goes to the author(s) since they generated the easy to install ezpackages of the extension. This means you can use the admin to upload the extension into your site, it also means don't need to edit any settings to activate and use :)&#13;
&#13;
Again, wonderful work! I can't wait till your next contribution. Thank you for your continued support of the eZ Community!&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <description>Huy this rocks, &#13;
&#13;
While i will rush to try this out now, i just wanted to send you congrats.&#13;
A few things, from the top of my head : &#13;
 - The Gmail/GDocs Auto-save ergonomics are excellent (label on buttons changing, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
Keep-up !&#13;
