      <title>What is the expected behavior of this extension?</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/akismet/forum/general/what_is_the_expected_behavior_of_this_extension</link>
      <description>We have installed it but I am not sure it is right. What I see is an admin interface which lists all objects (specified in the settings) that are supposed to be checked for spam content. There is no indication if the object is spam or not, and objects are published and visible to the public whether or not they are spam. In other words, it seems the extension does not do anything to control spam. I would expect it to reject spammy comments and only those would be in the list under /reportspam. Is there a list of required attributes that content has to have to be properly evaluated?</description>

      <description>Hello Sebastiaan van der Vliet,&#13;
&#13;
We recently merged both versions of the extension into one repository available at, https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/akismet&#13;
&#13;
With this repository you can choose either the 3.x or 4.x (or master) branches to use.&#13;
&#13;
We hope this helps others with a need for this solution.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <description>Hello eZ Community using akismet extension!&#13;
&#13;
Brookins Consulting is happy to announce we have created a full and complete import of the entire project's svn repository into a git based repository on GitHub.&#13;
&#13;
https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/akismet&#13;
&#13;
We will strive to keep this friendly fork / mirror up to date with any changes that come in the future from the forums and other forks in an effort to remain compatible with the latest versions of eZ Publish.&#13;
&#13;
Anyone is free to use (clone) this repository, just watch it for changes, or fork this new repository and use it as needed freely. This is a friendly mirror of the extension.&#13;
&#13;
Currently the latest version provided by the mirror is r12 | Cyberwolf | 2009-01-20 08:15:13 -0600 (Tue, 20 Jan 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <title>Updated version for eZ publish 4.x</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/akismet/forum/general/updated_version_for_ez_publish_4_x</link>
      <description>Based on this extension we released an updated version for eZ publish 4.x:&#13;
&#13;
The version for 4.x differs from the version by Kristof:&#13;
- It is not integrated with the ez approval workflow, but can of course be combined with the approval workflow;&#13;
- It does not require custom information extrator php classes, but can be configured in the configuration file;&#13;
- It uses the PHP5 version of the Akismet class developed by Bret Kuhns, improving performance;&#13;
- The name of the module view 'akismet/submit' has been changed to 'akismet/reportspam';&#13;
&#13;
It is available at:&#13;
