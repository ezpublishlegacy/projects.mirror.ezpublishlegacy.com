      <description>Thanks Kirk for your solution. I too recieved the error, and was going through my configuration looking for problems. Luckily, I choose to do a quick search for the issue and found this posting. This saved me from at least 1 reload.   </description>

      <description>This is an alert from TinyMCE, so not something I can do anything about unless I hack it, something I have no plans on starting doing as it will lead to more overhead on maintaining it.</description>

      <description>Andre, when I looked further into this I found that jQuery is part of the extension ezjscore. When I checked the extensions (in "Setup/Extensions" in the admin interface) I found that the ezjscore extension had not been selected and activated. Once I activated it then jQuery was instantiated and the tiny_mce editor worked.&#13;
&#13;
I would like to recommend that you change your popup message from "Load jQuery first!" to something more useful, such as: "Be sure to install the extension ezjscore so that jQuery will be instantiated. Extensions can be installed from the Admin interface by selecting Setup and then selecting Extensions".&#13;
&#13;
Thanks for all your work on this. It is certainly appreciated.&#13;

      <description>Some possible options:&#13;
* Using rewrite rules doc.ez.no: http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.5/Installation/Virtual-host-setup&#13;
* Grab newer version of ezoe form one of the recent builds of eZ Publish (Community version or not)</description>

      <title>problems with install (load jQuery first!)</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/ezoe2/forum/setup_install/problems_with_install_load_jquery_first</link>
      <description>We have version 4.4.0 of eZPublish that I upgraded from 4.0.3 using eZUpgrade. It appears that everything is working as we expect it to except for the editor which - even though the enable / disable editor button appears - doesn't allow us to instantiate the editor. Instead we get a popup message that says "Load jQuery first!".&#13;
&#13;
I used FireBug in FireFox to step through the JavaScript and found that the message is coming from line 397 of tiny_mce.jquery.js. And that what is happening is that jQuery is never instantiated within "window" in the DOM. Thus "window.jQuery" has a value of "undefined".&#13;
&#13;
It appears that the initialization of "window.tinyMCE" / "window.tinymce" is successful within lines 1 to 390 of tiny_mce_jquery.js, but that the initialization of "window.jQuery" fails.&#13;
&#13;
I tried reinstalling the ezoe extension and faithfully followed the install directions step by step. Our System Admin setup the rewrite rules exactly as specified for a virtual host (http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.4/Installation/Virtual-host-setup).&#13;
&#13;
&lt;code&gt;&#13;
RewriteEngine On&#13;
&#13;
RewriteRule ^/([^/]+/)?content/treemenu.* /index_treemenu\.php [L]&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/var/([^/]+/)?storage/images(-versioned)?/.* - [L]&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/var/([^/]+/)?cache/(texttoimage|public)/.* - [L]&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/design/[^/]+/(stylesheets|images|javascript)/.* - [L]&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/share/icons/.* - [L]&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/extension/[^/]+/design/[^/]+/(stylesheets|flash|images|lib|javascripts?)/.* - [L]&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/packages/styles/.+/(stylesheets|images|javascript)/[^/]+/.* - [L]&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/packages/styles/.+/thumbnail/.* - [L]&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/var/storage/packages/.* - [L]&#13;
&#13;
        #  Makes it possible to place your favicon at the root of your&#13;
        #  eZ Publish instance. It will then be served directly.&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/favicon\.ico - [L]&#13;
        # Uncomment the line below if you want your favicon to be served&#13;
        # from the standard design. You can customize the path to&#13;
        # favicon.ico by changing /design/standard/images/favicon\.ico&#13;
        #RewriteRule ^/favicon\.ico /design/standard/images/favicon\.ico [L]&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/design/standard/images/favicon\.ico - [L]&#13;
&#13;
        # Give direct access to robots.txt for use by crawlers (Google,&#13;
        # Bing, Spammers..)&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/robots\.txt - [L]&#13;
&#13;
        # Platform for Privacy Preferences Project ( P3P ) related files&#13;
        # for Internet Explorer&#13;
        # More info here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3p&#13;
        RewriteRule ^/w3c/p3p\.xml - [L]&#13;
&#13;
        # Uncomment the following lines when using popup style debug&#13;
        # RewriteRule ^/var/cache/debug\.html.* - [L]&#13;
        # RewriteRule ^/var/[^/]+/cache/debug\.html.* - [L]&#13;
&#13;
        RewriteRule .* /index\.php&#13;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;/code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The only thing left for me to check is one of the rewrite rules which you specify in your install instructions as being the following for a virtual host which is what we are hosting eZPublish on.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
RewriteRule ^/var/([^/]+/)?cache/public/.* - [L]&#13;
&#13;
&lt;/code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One final clue to this puzzle is that I tried switching back to the previous editor, ezdhtml, by turning its extension on, turning ezoe's extension off, clearing the cache, etc and that editor doesn't work either.&#13;
&#13;
Any insights you can provide will be greatly appreciated. I've already spent a few days working on this and am running out of areas to explore. Thanks!&#13;

      <description>Your rewrite rules are not the same as in the doc: http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.5/Installation/Virtual-host-setup&#13;
&#13;
Among others:&#13;
Rewriterule ^/extension/[^/]+/design/[^/]+/(stylesheets|images|javascripts|lib|flash?)/.* - [L]</description>

      <title>still no WYSIWYG</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/ezoe2/forum/setup_install/still_no_wysiwyg</link>
      <description>Hello,&#13;
after checking the Install process and the FAQ, I stil can't get the ezoe extension to work, on ezpublish community 4.2011.5 (upgrading from ezpublish 4.1.3)&#13;
&#13;
my rewrite rules : http://pastebin.com/unddPRkA&#13;
&#13;
I tried disabling ezjscore by putting &#13;
[eZJSCore]&#13;
Packer=disabled&#13;
at the end of, successively, settings/site.ini, settings/override/site.ini.append.php, settings/ezwebin_site/cache/site.ini.append.php&#13;
&#13;
The image class is the correct one, but I still added &#13;
[RelationGroupSettings]&#13;
ImagesClassList[]=image&#13;
at the end of settings/override/site.ini.append.php&#13;
&#13;
Up to now, nothing worked from the FAQ/install. any idea someone?</description>
