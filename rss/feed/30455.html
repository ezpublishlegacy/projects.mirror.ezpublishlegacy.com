      <title>nodes are disappearing on importing class</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/object_content_class_change/forum/general/nodes_are_disappearing_on_importing_class</link>
      <description>Hello Everyone, I am using two environments say dev and qa. I have a class in dev and there is an object which is inheriting properties of that class. qa also has same structure. Now, we add an attribute in the class in dev environment and the corresponding object is updated properly. Then, I export this class in a package and import in qa environment. While importing   I select 'replace the existing class' option. The class is imported properly with the new attribute but the corresponding nodes are not visible in the tree structure. &#13;
When i made a drill through, i observed that there is a new row added in the ezcontentclass table for the same class with a new class_id and the previous existing row with the previous class_id for the same class got deleted. And also there is no row corresponding to the previous existed class_id in ezcontentobject table.&#13;
&#13;
We can manipulate in database to get the solution, but I was hoping if there is any solution from ezPublish admin side.&#13;
&#13;
Your help is greatly appreciated.</description>

      <description>Hello :)&#13;
&#13;
Even version from Github is not really ez 4.x compatibile, as scripts fails in many ways. For example it makes huge mess on multi language objects, be careful with it!&#13;
&#13;
I'm back in eZ business, so I'll try to fix it and do some refactorization. </description>

      <description>I put a fork of this extension on Github that works in eZ Publish 4.x:&#13;

&#13;
Harry: the option is in the context menu (right click on an objects icon &gt; change class)&#13;

      <description>Hi Sander, Bartek,&#13;
&#13;
An update for eZ version 4 would be greatly appreciated!&#13;
Also some instructions for installation, even if it's only very brief. Copied the extension, enabled it, but can't find any button, menu option, whatever. Where to look?&#13;
&#13;
Thanks!&#13;

      <description>Hi Bartek,&#13;
&#13;
I have used this extension quite some times, it is a real life saver during refactoring sprints.&#13;
In order to keep this extension working with eZ Publish 4 some slight modifications are needed. I would be happy to send what I have altered in order to make it work. Could you update your code?&#13;
Or, if you're not willing to further maintaing this project, I am happy to take over because this is one of the most useful projects ;)&#13;
&#13;
Thanks!&#13;
