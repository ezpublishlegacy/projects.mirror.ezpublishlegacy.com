      <description>Proxy Sites hide your IP address and thereby prevent your from unauthorized access to your computer through the Internet. They do not provide anyone with your IP address and effectively hide any information about you and your reading interests. Besides that, they don’t even let anyone know that you are surfing through a proxy server.</description>

      <title>Citrus Aurantium extract </title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/extract/forum/general/citrus_aurantium_extract</link>
      <description>Citrus Aurantium extract &#13;
&#13;
CAS No. :  94-07-5&#13;
 Part Used:  Furit peel&#13;
 Appearance: White powder&#13;
 Specifications: 6% 30% 60% 98% HPLC&#13;
 Molecular Formula:  C9H13NO2&#13;
 Molecular Weight:  167.21&#13;
&#13;
Synephrine&#13;
 Synephrine is the main "active" compound found in the fruit of a plant called citrus aurantium. The fruit citrus aurantium is also known as zhi shi (in traditional Chinese medicine), and as green orange, sour orange and bitter orange in other parts of the world. Synephrine is chemically very similar to the ephedrine and pseudo-ephedrine found in many OTC cold/allergy medications and in a number of weight loss and energy supplements which contain Ma Huang.&#13;
 Synephrine is a drug commonly used for weight loss. While its effectiveness is widely debated, synephrine has gained significant popularity as an alternative to ephedrine, a related substance which has been made illegal or restricted in many countries due to health risks and citrus aurantium extract synephrine used as a precursor in the illicit manufacturing ofmethamphetamine.&#13;
 There is however no occurrence of diverted synephrine for the manufacture of amphetamines, and the naturally occurring citrus aurantium extract synephrine is, due to its phenolic group, unsuitable for such diversion. Synephrine containing bitter orange or synephrine are suspected of causing adverse cardiovascular reactions.Synephrine is derived primarily from the immature fruit of citrus aurantium, a relatively small citrus tree.&#13;
 In application of traditional Chinese medical science, synephrine is used to dispel bloating and a lump in the abdomen and phlegm, and to cureedema, constipation, gastroptosis, prolapse of uterus and rectocele.&#13;
  &#13;
Application&#13;
 Citrus Aurantium Extract is used as a dietary supplement designed to support calorie burning (thermogenesis) and resulting weight loss.&#13;
 Citrus Aurantium Extract is used in pharmaceutical field.Synephrine helps to clean the blood and has been reported to dissolve kidney stones.&#13;
 Citrus Aurantium Extract also is a stimulant, similar to and ephedrine, Synephrine is thought to have similar effects in terms of providing an energy boost, suppressing appetite and increasing metabolic rate and caloric expenditure.&#13;
  &#13;
Main Function:&#13;
 (1). With the function of increasing capillary toughness, lowering cholesterol;  &#13;
 (2). With the function of treating cardiovascular disease;  &#13;
 (3). With the function of anti-virus and anti-inflammatory;  &#13;
 (4). With the function of treating diseases such as hypertension and heart attack.</description>

      <description>It is nice you found Flowplayer but if you need an html5 video player that can guarantuee http live streaming , cross-platform, without any plugins such as Flash or Silverlight, I would suggest to take a look at THEOplayer from https://www.theoplayer.com &#13;
&#13;
To me, it looks the most comprehensive html5 video player, and all that WITHOUT plugins!! &#13;

      <description>The sort for subattr_star_rating___rating_average____f is not possible because it is a multi-valued field (as Peter describes).&#13;
&#13;
I'm unsure why the attribute (attr_) code was omitted from the indexing class but here is a simple snippet to add it based on the average value calculation. This will allow sorting.&#13;
&#13;
1. As mentioned before, add the "CustomMap[ezsrrating]=ezfSolrDocumentFieldStarRating" to the ezfind.ini.append.php&#13;
&#13;
2. Edit esfDocumentFieldStarRating.php&#13;
line 27-ish in the getData() function just before the return $data;&#13;
&#13;
       // DJS @ BFRE - Add attribute during data population to permit sorting&#13;
       $sAttributeName= parent::getFieldName($contentClassAttribute );&#13;
       $data[$sAttributeName] = $contentObjectAttribute-&gt;attribute('rating_average');&#13;
&#13;
If this is done in a custom extension then ezfind remains unmodified</description>

      <title> Needing advise of payment gateway for my webstore</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/xrowecommerce/forum/general/needing_advise_of_payment_gateway_for_my_webstore</link>
      <description>Hello guys:&#13;
&#13;
I am so sorry if this has been asked elsewhere but I could not find the exact answer I was looking for.  I have set up the test shop on a ecommerce platform and only ticked the PayPal option. But some errors occured when using paypal. Well, the detail is, my client wants to use the full features of PayPal, i.e. customers can pay by credit card through the PayPal checkout or use their PayPal account. Am I overlooking something or does the webstore PayPal option mean just that, PayPal account only and for credit card payments it has to be another payment gateway? That would upset me . I am sure I am doing something wrong? Who can help me?On the other hand, many clients have emailed me to ask me to provide another payment options like bitcoin or other digital currency since some of them live in Non-Paypal accepted countries, and a large part of them introduce the epay global payment to my website since it's free to pay and get paid, what's more, almost all the countries are available to use it----far better than paypal would be in this point. I have heard of it before buy haven't tryied yet, does it mean that i need to connect epay payment gateway? I can't find futher details on their website http://www.epay.com about the api. Any suggestions here?   &#13;

      <title>Unable to send newsletters in eZ Publish 5 legacy stack</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/cjw_newsletter/forum/general/unable_to_send_newsletters_in_ez_publish_5_legacy_stack</link>
      <description>I need some urgent help please. I've installed CJW Newsletter on behalf of a client who needs to use it during a launch within a week. Everything has been running very well right up until I did the first newsletter test run.  Preview emails get sent out fine but not newsletter via crontab at all, they get struck in &#13;
&#13;
It seems that ezpublish_legacy/extension/cjw_newsletter/cronjobs/cjw_newsletter_mailqueue_process.php cronjob is not found.  We tried running it via&#13;
php runcronjobs.php cjw_newsletter_mailqueue_process&#13;
and&#13;
php ezpublish/console ezpublish:legacy:script runcronjobs.php cjw_newsletter_mailqueue_process&#13;
&#13;
With no results: it does not seem to use the correct cronjob.ini and uses the default site.ini from settings/site.ini which does not have the right database credentials also.&#13;
&#13;
When the news http://projects.ez.no/cjw_newsletter/news/cjw_newsletter_and_ez_publish_5 was made was the cron process function tested? &#13;
&#13;
Thank you</description>

&#13;
Fantastic! Thanks for sharing. &#13;
&#13;
I was pretty sure there was another key reason why I trust using Netgen software :)&#13;
&#13;
New stack bundles are a nice benefit that make the transition to New stack much eZier :)&#13;

&#13;
Thanks Heath for mentioning our work. We used the birthday thing indeed on several projects. It has also the new stack fieldtype so you can do frontend work in twig:&#13;

      <link>http://projects.ez.no/birthday/forum/general/is_working_with_4_7/re_is_working_with_4_73</link>
      <description>Hello Anselme Chorein,&#13;
&#13;
Thank you for posting to this thread your suggested solution.&#13;
&#13;
I had avoided addressing the topic of the split / forks of the birthday datatype solution for a long time waiting for more progress to be made publicly before speaking on this topic. Unfortunately I kept putting this post off for far too long.&#13;
&#13;
What many users don't realize is that long ago (some time after 4.3+ api changes) the svn repository for this project became unmaintained, which for end users / developers is very unfortunate.&#13;
&#13;
Fortunately from this negative sprung a different kind of positive result ... forks (from what I have seen a fair number of them). First private forks (with only required or minimal modifications) then later public and unique forks. &#13;
&#13;
Most of the forks are fairly similar, I think because this solution was created and refined early on in it's lifetime / history and as they say, it it ain't broke ... no need to fix it :)&#13;
&#13;
&lt;b&gt;Today I quickly see these forks&lt;/b&gt;:&#13;
&#13;
- &lt;b&gt;Xrow&lt;/b&gt;: While have not seen a public xrow git repository of this extension. I have seen that they have a version of the datatype with the xrowforum extension (though I do wish they would maintain a submodule instead). Though it seems that little to no continued improvements have been made to this copy, https://github.com/xrowgmbh/xrowforum/blob/master/datatypes/ezbirthday/ezbirthdaytype.php&#13;
&#13;
- &lt;b&gt;eab-dev&lt;/b&gt;: This fork seems to be a full history import of the svn repository, patched with the required 4.3 api changes (ezpI18n::tr) and a helpful though slightly inaccurate README.md file, https://github.com/eab-dev/birthday/&#13;
&#13;
---- Users who might consider using the svn repository provided by this project would be better served in the long run to use this git repository instead.&#13;
&#13;
-  &lt;b&gt;Netgen&lt;/b&gt;: This fork seems to be import of the svn sources (without it's history), patched with the required 4.3 api changes (ezpI18n::tr) but without a helpful accurate README.md file, https://github.com/netgen/birthday&#13;
&#13;
---- I think that users who use composer to install extensions should consider using the Netgen fork over the other sources. Also Netgen does very good eZ Publish work in the community and has proven themselves open to collaboration on public extension Pull Requests for bugfixes and other helpful improvements. &#13;
&#13;
In light of all that I have shared, the next time I want to depend on a vendor's fork of this extension datatype (with respect to the vendors history of proper maintenance of a public resource and collaboration on it's development) ... I would choose to build upon the Netgen fork first.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;b&gt;In short: Please do not use the (eZ Publish &lt;= 4.2) svn repository copy of this extension any longer unless your using a copy of eZ Publish 4.2 (or lesser version). Everyone else should use one of the publicly available Git based repositories instead (which have already been updated properly to support versions of eZ Publish 4.3 (or greater version))&lt;/b&gt;&#13;
&#13;
If I have missed or omitted another public fork of this extension datatype, which is more than just a git repo with the needed 4.3+ api bugfixes / prior svn version history ... please share a link here in this forum thread so that others can properly consider which fork will best suite their needs and requirements.&#13;
&#13;
I hope this summary helps others!&#13;
&#13;
Take it eZ!&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <description>Hello eZ Community using rssfeedoperator extension!&#13;
&#13;
Brookins Consulting is happy to announce we have created a complete mirror import of the project's svn repository into a git based repository on GitHub.&#13;
&#13;
https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/bcrssfeeds&#13;
&#13;
We continue strive to keep this friendly fork / mirror up to date with any changes that come in the future from the forums and other forks in an effort to remain compatible with the latest versions of eZ Publish.&#13;
&#13;
Anyone is free to use (clone) this repository, just watch it for changes, or fork this new repository and use it as needed freely. This is a friendly mirror of the extension.&#13;
&#13;
The mirror import was based on the latest svn version, r1 | bd | 24/07/2008 11:25 am.&#13;
&#13;
The GitHub version provides new features and continued compatibility with eZ Publish Community Project 2014.11 aka eZ Publish 5.x&#13;
&#13;
Brookins Consulting has refactored the solution to be slightly more compatible with eZ Publish 5.x and to include the features contributed by Kristof Coomans.&#13;
&#13;

      <title>Modern alternatives to paradoxpdf for PDF generation</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/paradoxpdf/forum/general/modern_alternatives_to_paradoxpdf_for_pdf_generation</link>
      <description>Hello,&#13;
&#13;
Recently Thiago Campos Viana of mugo.ca blogged on share.ez.no about an exciting new PDF generation solution for eZ Publish developed by mugo.ca! &#13;
&#13;
His blog post is titled, "Generate highly customized PDFs with wkhtmltopdf and eZ Publish" and is available here, http://share.ez.no/blogs/thiago-campos-viana/generate-highly-customized-pdfs-with-wkhtmltopdf-and-ez-publish&#13;
&#13;
Here is an important snippet from the blog post which is particularly of interest to both existing paradoxpdf users and new users considering using paradoxpdf for pdf creation.&#13;
&#13;
"&lt;i&gt;However due to its (paradoxpdf/flying-sauser) lack of HTML5 + CSS3 support and relatively high server load, we decided to look for an alternative solution. We found that wkhtmltopdf does a great job at producing highly styled PDFs, and we were able to integrate it nicely with eZ Publish.&#13;
&#13;
Among the downsides of ParadoxPDF are that it is based on the Java application flying-saucer, which has not been updated since 2011. It only supports CSS2, and doesn't support page breaks using CSS for example. wkhtmltopdf uses qtwebkit, which supports HTML5 and CSS3, and is actively maintained.&#13;
&#13;
We also ran some performance tests and found that wkhtmltopdf can generate PDFs up to twice as fast as ParadoxPDF.&lt;/i&gt;"&#13;
&#13;
We (BC) thinks that this is an extremely important evolution of public pdf generation solutions for eZ Publish that other users should seriously consider. Especially when the ParadoxPDF solution is showing serious signs of age because flying-saucer is not being actively maintained. Here is an example where this recently affected other users, http://projects.ez.no/paradoxpdf/forum/issues/paradoxpdf_and_svg_image_format#msg53124&#13;
&#13;
If you would like to try the new mugo_wkhtmltopdf solution out, the source code can be found on GitHub, https://github.com/mugoweb/mugo_wkhtmltopdf/&#13;
&#13;
I hope this helps others!&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <description>Hi Edi,&#13;
&#13;
Do you test with which eZtags version? I use version 1.3.0&#13;
I compare version 1.3.0 and 2.0 beta, there are different.&#13;

      <description>Hi,&#13;
&#13;
without physical access to your eZ Publish installation, I doubt I can help you.&#13;
&#13;
I tested eZ Tags now on eZ Publish 4.4 and everything works as expected.</description>

      <description>Hi Edi,&#13;
&#13;
Thank again for your reply. My eZpublish version is 4.4, I know it's not the last one but it's like that!&#13;
Yes I would like to adapt my version to make avalaible the "Grant access to all functions" button.&#13;
Is there any body help me to solve this problem? I'm continuing to looking for solutions.&#13;
Best regards&#13;

      <description>Hi Veronique,&#13;
&#13;
unfortunately, I cannot reproduce the issue.&#13;
&#13;
I tested on the latest version of eZ Publish and "Grant access to all functions" button remains functional, and I can allow access to all functions of tags module.&#13;
&#13;
It probably has something to do with your specific installation. Maybe you have some hacks running on it?</description>

      <description>Hi Edi,&#13;
&#13;
Thanks for this information but when Ichoose 'tags' in "Module" dropdown, the "Grant access to all functions" button is not available and the first element of "function" dropdown is displayed! &#13;
So I've only the possibility to create one policy by each function&#13;
Is there any eZtag extension modification to solve this problem?&#13;
&#13;
Regards&#13;
Véronique&#13;

      <description>Hi Veronique,&#13;
&#13;
That's fairly standard part of eZ Publish funcionality and is not related to eZ Tags.&#13;
&#13;
When adding a new policy, choose "tags" from "Module" dropdown and click "Grant access to all functions" button.&#13;
&#13;

      <description>When I create new policy for my dedicated users role, Is it possible to have a function 'all functions' in the function list? To give access for all functions, I've created one policy for each function of tags module&#13;
Thanks for your reply&#13;

      <description>Hi Edi,&#13;
&#13;
Sorry, I've added the all these 3 functions 'edit', view' and 'read'!&#13;
But with only 'read' function, the eZtags tab is displayed, great!!&#13;
Thanks again&#13;
