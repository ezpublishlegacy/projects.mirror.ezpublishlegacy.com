      <title>Feature suggestions</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/cjw_contexthelp/forum/general/feature_suggestions</link>
      <description>I thought I'd start a thread for suggestions that people may have.  Here is a few from me.&#13;
&#13;
* Alter the mouse-over pop-up method to allow for mouse access to pop-up content.  ie. It's currently impossible to click a hyper-link that appears in the pop-up content.</description>

      <description>Fair enough Felix.  I soldered on and completed the massive template edit job and will redo it once the new feature arrives.&#13;
&#13;
Do let me know what the ball-park for the cost of this would be as I will contribute if possible.</description>

      <description>This is only an idea how this can be managed. &#13;
I do not plan it to implement it until a customer is paying for it. Sorry.</description>

      <description>While I'm always fond of ini files for sheer speed I think idea 2. is superior, mainly because delivers a consistent user experience within the extension.  One great feature is that I'm able to provide a client with direct access to control class descriptions, mouse-over tips etc with out letting them anywhere near the actual classes, this would complete the picture.  So option 2 gets my vote.&#13;
&#13;
Are you able to give me a rough idea of when you could do this, it will help me decide what to do from here as I can't leave this class mid-edited and thinking I should roll it back manually.</description>

      <description>Hi Brendan,&#13;
&#13;
wow - you are a heavy fieldset user ;-)&#13;
&#13;
We are using the fieldset feature with a class of 40 attributes 5 of them are fieldset attributes.&#13;
&#13;
It is maybe not the best implementation, because every attribute blows up the database. But it was the easiers implementation for us.&#13;
&#13;
I have 2 ideas to but the fieldset definition outside of class edit.&#13;
&#13;
1. use an ini setting to define (disadvantage the fieldsetnames you have to put in i18n)&#13;
&#13;
2. use a new contentstructur for fieldsets, like the contexthelp structure to define the fieldsets&#13;
=&gt; extend the operator to get the fieldset structure for a class in edit.tpl&#13;
&#13;
The 2. idea i think would be the best way.&#13;
&#13;
What do you think?&#13;
&#13;

      <description>Thought I would report back on things.  I've found this extension brilliant and delivering pretty much all I wanted.  My only gripe is that I've found the requirement to edit a class and insert stop/stop fieldsets inefficient and frustrating.  It isn't a problem on smaller classes but I'm currently mid-way through doing one that uses 129 attributes, 45 of which are "CJW Fieldset" attributes which are required as I'm using several levels of nested fieldsets.&#13;
Previously this grouping was handled by templates inserting h2/h3 etc but I'm replacing it with this extension as it offers a lot of advantages.&#13;
&#13;
None the less I'm going crazy, I should say I'm this is on a 4.2.0 site also so its probably more eZ Publish's poor class editing interface more than anything else.  But having to choose from either a million mouse clicks or doing painful attribute number changes praying that not a single mistake was made in the manual sequential renumbering or you loose everything.  Just insane!&#13;
&#13;
So a method of controlling fieldsets that didn't rely on class editing would be nice.&#13;
&#13;
Any tips to ease my pain, I checked for ajax class editing extensions but couldn't locate one that I could trust on a 4.2.0 production site.</description>

      <description>Thanks Felix!  I'm feeling very special right now :)&#13;
&#13;
I'll only be using on the public side also, I've installed on 4.2.x and its working great, this site will be getting upgrade to 4.5.0 soon so I'll let you know how I get on with it there too.&#13;
&#13;
It's a really useful extension which I'll be using in other projects soon I'm sure, I'll provide feedback as I can.&#13;

      <description>Hi Brendan,&#13;
&#13;
i just uploaded a new package of cjw_contexthelp ( for you ;-) ).&#13;
http://projects.ez.no/index.php/cjw_contexthelp/downloads/cjw_contexthelp_2_2_0_201103281009_zip&#13;
&#13;
This is working wor us on ez4.4.&#13;
It would be nice to give us feedback if it is working for you.&#13;
&#13;
If you want to have the contexthelp for editors in the admin interface you have to override the edit + edit_attribute.tpl for the admin / admin2 design. &#13;
This is not done at the moment - we are using it only for the frontend.&#13;
In the admin we only writing the content for the contexthelp.&#13;
&#13;
Please give us feedback - if all is fine or you have something to improve.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers&#13;
Felix&#13;

      <description>Hi Donat&#13;
&#13;
I may have a client interested in using this on 4.4/4.5, what needs to be done to upgrade this, is it something I could contribute towards getting done?&#13;

      <description>Hi Marko&#13;
&#13;
the extension contains all the templates needed. Be aware, however, that it has been released and tested under 4.0.1  had we had some issues with installing on later versions. And it will certainly need some reworking for the new admin interface.&#13;
&#13;

      <description>If I install this extension will it work in the admin interface out of the box?&#13;
&#13;
Or do I have to change the admin templates?</description>

      <description>Hello Branislav,&#13;
&#13;
at the moment i have no running 4.0.3 and 4.1. &#13;
I don't know why the package not working for ez 4.0.3. You wrote that you test the extenion on ez 4.0.1 and it works :-).&#13;
&#13;
1. Solution - you update this insallation to ez 4.0.3 and create a new class export package.&#13;
&#13;
2. Solution - you create the the classes manually&#13;
&#13;
Thank's for your feedback.&#13;

      <description>Hi,&#13;
&#13;
I have tested your extension on eZ 4.0.1 and it works great. But i have problem when trying to use it on eZ 4.0.3 (and 4.1). Problem was that eZ won't install package file located in /extension/cjw_contexthelp/packages/cjw_contexthelp_3-Classes-2.0-1.ezpkg.&#13;
&#13;
eZ just say "The package name cjw_contexthelp_3-Classes is invalid, cannot import the package"&#13;
&#13;
Will there be some new version of this package, or how to solve this?&#13;
&#13;
Thanks,&#13;

      <description>Hi Jorge&#13;
&#13;
You need to define one Context Help Container using the "CJW Contexthelp Container Class". You can put it anywhere you like. See http://projects.ez.no/cjw_contexthelp/gallery/screenshots/administrative_interface_help_class_container_structure.&#13;
&#13;
Within this Container, add a "CJW Contexthelp Class" object for every class you want to have this feature enabled. You can define a global help text for this class, see http://projects.ez.no/cjw_contexthelp/gallery/screenshots/administrative_interface_global_help_for_a_class.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, you need to define a "CJW Contexthelp Class Attribute" object for every attribute you want to provide help on. You have to define these as children of the corresponding CJW Contexthelp Class object, see http://projects.ez.no/cjw_contexthelp/gallery/screenshots/administrative_interface_help_for_a_single_attribute.&#13;
&#13;
You will not see any difference in the class definition in the backend. It's effect is in the frontside editing, see http://projects.ez.no/cjw_contexthelp/gallery/screenshots/context_sensitive_help_in_frontside_editing.&#13;
&#13;
It relies on the modified edit template being installed (extension/cjw_contexthelp/design/standard/templates/content/edit_attribute.tpl). Please check this.&#13;
&#13;

      <description>Sorry, Im back again...&#13;
&#13;
I just installed the packadge, whent to my tree root:&#13;
&#13;
&lt;code&gt;&#13;
 Home&#13;
 Products&#13;
 Solutions&#13;
 Training&#13;
 Support&#13;
...&#13;
Also my new custom folders are here&#13;
&lt;/code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
and made a help folder item, inside I stated to make a instance of "CJW Contexthelp Container" for a custom class, and within this instance item several "CJW Contexthelp Class" for each attribute. All fine.&#13;
&#13;
I then edited a class object  (associated with the contexthelp, of course) already made a few days ago to see if the icon that shows the help appeared. But sitill something is wrong as nothing appears at all.&#13;
&#13;
I do not know if it has to do with the location of the CJW Contexthelp Container. Looking up at the description you made I noticed "For every class you want to define help for, add a "CJW Contexthelp Class" object below", Below what?&#13;
&#13;
Can you specify more, please...&#13;
&#13;

      <description>Hi Jorge,&#13;
&#13;
The 'CJW Contexthelp Container' is a new ez class. In the extension their is an ez package which install 3 new classes.&#13;
&#13;
The container class is only just a folder.&#13;
In the container you can create new  contexthelp class help objects and under class help object - attribute help objects.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;code&gt;&#13;
context_help_container&#13;
- class_help_object1&#13;
-- attribute_help_11&#13;
-- attribute_help_12&#13;
- class_help_object2&#13;
-- attribute_help_21&#13;
- class_help_object3&#13;
&lt;/code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Was this your question?&#13;
You can place the conainer anywhere in the ez system. The operator will fetch these object and ignoring visibilty and the right system of ez.&#13;
&#13;
Best regards&#13;

      <description>Hello&#13;
&#13;
I cannot understand the following:&#13;
&#13;
&lt;code&gt;&#13;
In the administration interface, define a Context Help Container using the "CJW Contexthelp Container". &#13;
&lt;/code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Where in the admin interfase?&#13;
Using "CJW Contexthelp Container"? Is this a class? Just cant find where to create it.&#13;
&#13;
It seems once I create it all will go nicely.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
unfortunately putting together all the stuff for this extension has been delayed by a custom project. But we will provide a download within the next days.&#13;

      <description>Hi Donat&#13;
&#13;
You're spot on.  I simply misinterpreted the extensions capabilities after looking at the screen shot.  The new image in the gallery makes it very clear.&#13;
&#13;
Thanks for a nice extension.</description>

      <description>Hi Brendan&#13;
&#13;
thanks for your comment!&#13;
&#13;
probably the screenshot showing the help for a complex attribute was misleading. I have added another screenshot to the galley showing a full edit screen with both a global help, defined per class, and specific help, defined per attribute (see http://projects.ez.no/cjw_contexthelp/gallery/screenshots/context_sensitve_help_per_class_and_per_attribute ).&#13;
&#13;
A problem arises when complex attributes consisting of different elements (such as the user account, url or our geoaddress datatype) are rendered. The standard edit template treats such attributes as one entity and thus does not allow a finer granulation. So far, we think that this is a minor deficiency, as these elements are usually tightly coupled and profit from being explained together.&#13;
&#13;
Regards&#13;

      <description>Hi Brendan,&#13;
&#13;
Thank's for your suggestion.&#13;
You mean that sometimes the attribute help is very long?&#13;
In this case you can implement your own view mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
At the moment only a hidden div with the help is set to visible. But in your example you can  may be open a overlaywindow with page navigation.&#13;
&#13;
You can do what you want in ez way :-) because all help are stored in ContentObjects.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers&#13;

      <title>Per attribute</title>

      <description>Hi Donat&#13;
&#13;
Certainly a nice extension concept, thought I would throw a suggestion your way.&#13;
If you were able to find a way to break up the help for each attribute it would be even better I think.  On some projects with extensive forms the explanation per attribute can be very lengthy and scroll over multiple pages.&#13;
&#13;
