      <description>Hi Gaetano,&#13;
&#13;
Looks good. I'm quite new to pake though.&#13;
&#13;
Some questions / suggestions:&#13;
* is it possible to place a default options.yaml for a single extension so I can omit the --extension parameter at the command line?&#13;
* I suggest to modify run_update_ezinfo() a bit to make it more generally useable, the part for updating the copyright seems to be very specific to eZ Systems now, I'd stick there with what has been configured in the yaml file like version and license parts do. Maybe you can add a placeholder for the current year, [YEAR], which can be used in the extension.xml then, to keep the current functionality for updating the upper boundary of the copyright year?</description>

on a side note [URL=http://www.losangelesasianescorts.com/]Los Angeles asian escort[/URL] does this mean I can record my singers and give them a copy for their own personal use if I make no profit from it.&#13;

      <description>@Felix: in an ideal world, a php based tool would be the best choice:&#13;
- we already have php installed in an eZ environment&#13;
- easier for php hackers to manipulate / extend&#13;
&#13;
The problem in the real world is that we'd need a tool that does the dependency solving first, and is widely in use (for guarantee of evolution and also getting all the base 'tasks' for free). &#13;
&#13;
And there is no such tool yet, afaik - some new things based on rake are showing promise though.&#13;
&#13;
I dislike ant with a passion, but the fact that the original script consisting of 7k lines of shell code was brought down to a mere 700 lines of xml is a nice advance.&#13;
&#13;
In short: would you try porting the existing tasks from the ant file to pake (or phake)? I just created a new 'branch' dir for it ;-)</description>

      <description>it is not easy to setup the ant tool.&#13;
I just try to use it again to build with the cjw_newsletter extension. But i give up. &#13;
At the moment is no GIT Support.&#13;
&#13;
So i start to write some php scripts which allows you to create packages.&#13;
&#13;
I start with building the filelist.md5 &#13;
&#13;
The idea is to have a special src checkout from git or svn an run on these e.g. for extension/xys or an other path some build scripts.&#13;
&#13;
1. create md5 hashes and store to path/ share/filelist.md5   (with ignore files settings)&#13;
=&gt; you can commit this md5 to svn / git so you have a froosen version :-) and have the possibility using svn and git checkouts on live with systemupgrade admin function checks&#13;
&#13;
2. Next create an tar.gz package with ezcompontents &#13;
&#13;
Like a minimal version of ANT but should be work in every ez installation.&#13;
&#13;
What do you think about that?&#13;

      <description>Good idea.&#13;
I'm currently on 1.8.1 - and honestly I prefer to have recent releases of the tool: I find that it is already too limited in its capabilities, and older versions even more so.&#13;
Do you have a build environment that you cannot upgrade?</description>

      <description>btw, automated generation of ext. tables was improved in 4.3 (not the php script allows to create table defs without sorting fields), but still not possible, as it misses generation of a given list of tables. Will be in 4.4 I hope...</description>

Look here rather: http://svn.projects.ez.no/ezextensionbuilder/branches/gg_170210_ezoracle_needs/build.xml&#13;

1. install a viable md5 cli tool on winblow&#13;

      <description>Hi I fixed it by doing this in the build.xml url&#13;
 &lt;code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
-&lt;taskdef resource="net/sf/antcontrib/antcontrib.properties"/&gt;&#13;
+&lt;taskdef resource="net/sf/antcontrib/antcontrib.properties"&gt;&#13;
+ &lt;classpath&gt;&#13;
+    &lt;pathelement location="/root/.ant/lib/ant-contrib-1.0b3-jar.jar"/&gt;&#13;
+ &lt;/classpath&gt;&#13;
+&lt;/taskdef&gt;&#13;
&#13;
 &lt;/code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
maybe an ant bug?&#13;
