      <description>Hello Lars Eirik R,&#13;
&#13;
The problem with this project is that it was created during the migration from auth.ez.no/community/contributions to projects.ez.no&#13;
&#13;
Sadly many contributions were badly imported without a thorough enough review.&#13;
&#13;
Leaving many projects creates with little to no actual records, missing downloads specifically, also missing screenshots and missing comments (migrated to a general topic thread for archival).&#13;
&#13;
Your best bet would be to contact bjorn @ xrow directly to see if they would be willing to share an older backup copy not currently publicly available. I searched Google for this extension but found no other mirrors.&#13;
&#13;
I hope this helps. Apologies for my late rely.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <title>Request : Code? </title>

      <description>Hi.&#13;
This looks really nice, but did you ever develop such a feature or was it just on the planning stage?&#13;
&#13;
If you have code which does not work for 4.0 i would be happy to take this and make it work for version 4x or 4.5&gt;</description>
