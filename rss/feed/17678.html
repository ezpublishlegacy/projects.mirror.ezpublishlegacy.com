      <description>That's fantastic, André. I use both OS X and XP. On the OS X side, I usually have trouble with the dependencies (ImageMagick, ensuring the correct version of Apache is installed, etc.). I know MAMP can alleviate some of this but I ran into conflicts with the few times I tried it.&#13;
&#13;
I've used XAMPP on the Windows side but never with eZ. Perhaps it's time to give it a try.&#13;
&#13;
Like I said in the OP, I know most of this is possible, it's just organizing the information in a central area.</description>

      <description>There are generally three camps, the gnu ones that have been on *nix all along and never will give up emac/vim, the mac os users that either came from windows or *nix and use TextMate + mamp mostly, and the Windows users that are used to Visual Studio and tend to migrate to Eclipse.&#13;
&#13;
So I guess this proposed doc will need three routes.&#13;
&#13;
Since I'm a Windows user myself I'll roughly outline the setup routine I go through:&#13;
1. Install wampserver* if you need to easily switch php versions between different projects or alternatively use the bitnami based eZ Publish installer** if you don't.&#13;
2. Install eclipse + pdt bundle (latest is 3.5 + 2.1) so you get code completion and other visual features in php&#13;
3. Install subclipse OR subversive to handle svn inside eclipse&#13;
4. [Optionally] Setup xdebug or zend debugger, both can give you php stack traces on errors and can be used for profiling, integrations with eclipse is also possible, search;)&#13;
4. [Optionally] If you have iis on the machine as well, then you need to reconfigure apache if you installed wamp, to use different port number, for instance 81(Think it was the 'Listen' directive, the cof file should be fairly good documented, so just open it using wamp tray icon -&gt; apache -&gt; configuration)&#13;
5. [Optionally] setup eclipse to use wamp's www folder as working directory, this way, you don't have to create virtual hosts for all new projects, but can browse them by accessing http://localhost[:81]/&lt;projectname&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Alternatively, you could try Zend Studio + Zend Core, witch will result in somewhat the same thing, but already setup for you, and maybe a bit slicker and better integrated, but I haven't tried it so don't really know.&#13;
&#13;
Note: there is one down side to Eclipse, its fairly slow.. Unless you are on Linux, so if you have a slow computer, then setting up the above(expect wamp, use package manager for things like that) on for instance Ubuntu instead would make a big difference for Eclipse and eZ Publish responsiveness!&#13;
&#13;
* http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php&#13;
(note, PHP 5.3 is not fully tested yet, and might contain regressions, so download PHP 5.2.8 from "Addons" if you are going to do serious development)&#13;

      <title>Workstation environments</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/doc/forum/article_suggestions/workstation_environments</link>
      <description>There are a lot of articles on server configuration, but we haven't found much on setting up an optimal dev environment. &#13;
&#13;
We're looking for information on IDEs, step debugging, etc. Many are making the jump from IIS/ASP .NET and Visual Studio to Apache/PHP5 and &lt;b&gt;[?]&lt;/b&gt;. I think the &lt;b&gt;[?]&lt;/b&gt; is the problem -- there are many IDEs and multiple versions of each IDE (ex. Eclipse). &#13;
&#13;
What IDEs/tools does eZ / the community use and how are they configured?</description>

      <description>André, yes. An object's storage and the methods that act upon it are require a fair amount of digging. Maybe its specific locations in the database tables aren't important for an article like this since they are encapsulated by the methods.</description>

      <description>So your talking about the life of the php eZ Object when it is requested?&#13;
Or also its life in the database from publish, request, translated, trashed/archived and deleted?</description>

      <title>The life of an eZ object</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/doc/forum/article_suggestions/the_life_of_an_ez_object</link>
      <description>The books (http://ez.no/store/books) and technical documentation cover this, but we need a developer perspective.&#13;
&#13;
What about an article about creating an example object and showing where information about it is dispersed in the system and how other parts of the system interface with it.&#13;
&#13;
Possible areas of focus:&#13;
- When an object is requested.&#13;
- When/how the object is cached and what parts are cached.&#13;
- When search index information is updated and what triggers it.</description>
