      <description>I have taken a brief moment to collect and organize a few of the existing snippets examples in ezpedia into a dedicated snippets namespace.&#13;
&#13;
It is our collective hope that at a later point these example snippets make their way into an organized structure in subversion for future maintenance and distribution.&#13;

      <description>Hello Eirik,&#13;
&#13;
eZ Snippets is a place to document existing references of eZ publish related source code snippets. [0]&#13;
&#13;
We noticed that a wiki was not always the greatest long term location to store example source code.&#13;
&#13;
These days .. most solutions eventually become community projects as extensions. (re: bccleanup from rss delete script)&#13;
&#13;
More abstract or general api source code snippets seem to be fine in eZpedia [1]&#13;
&#13;
We still think that a generic open commit policy project to organize and store small purpose example source code snippets which can be maintained in svn serves a valuable purpose.&#13;
&#13;
I could see the new doc project [1] already providing a better example of how to organize these kinds of requests and content related to text documentation.&#13;
&#13;
The idea can also be applied in the same way to source code snippets as well.&#13;
&#13;
At some point it is simpler to manage and maintain source code examples in svn.&#13;
&#13;
When the next version of eZ is released, updated svn source code examples can be populated from svn into other locations replacing previous examples.&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately I myself have not had a serious opportunity to take advantage of this project's resources yet to organize or publish existing source code example snippets or document potential candidates.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;
Heath&#13;

      <description>Hi,&#13;
&#13;
This project appears to be empty. Is that correct? Is so, it might be better to remove it.</description>
