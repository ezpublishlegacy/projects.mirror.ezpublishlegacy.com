      <title>Mirror of addcollabrule extension repository on GitHub!</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/addcollabrule/forum/general/mirror_of_addcollabrule_extension_repository_on_github</link>
      <description>Hello eZ Community using addcollabrule extension!&#13;
&#13;
Brookins Consulting is happy to announce we have created a full and complete import of the entire project's svn repository into a git based repository on GitHub.&#13;
&#13;
https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/addcollabrule&#13;
&#13;
We will strive to keep this friendly fork / mirror up to date with any changes that come in the future from the forums and other forks in an effort to remain compatible with the latest versions of eZ Publish.&#13;
&#13;
Anyone is free to use (clone) this repository, just watch it for changes, or fork this new repository and use it as needed freely. This is a friendly mirror of the extension.&#13;
&#13;
Currently the latest version provided by the mirror is r5 | nfrp | 2010-11-30 07:11:31 -0600 (Tue, 30 Nov 2010).&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;
Brookins Consulting&#13;

      <description>Hi Jeremy&#13;
&#13;
Better post your questions related to the membership extension in the membership project forums. There are some installation notes here: http://projects.ez.no/membership__1/downloads/documentation/notes</description>

      <description>Hi Kristof,&#13;
&#13;
I downloaded it, the trunk version for eZP 4/ PHP5. Well installed :)&#13;
So now I have the same like in the flash movie. I did the same as you.&#13;
But my problem still here : I (admin) don't receive any email to approve or not a membership of a new registered person. An anonymous registers and can straight after view member section. :(&#13;
How can I make it works ?&#13;
Thank you.</description>

      <description>Hi Jeremy&#13;
&#13;
The membership approval is a collaboration notification contained in the membership extension: http://projects.ez.no/membership__1. If you want to use the functionality of the membership extension then you need to install and enable it first ;) Good luck!</description>

      <description>Hi,&#13;
&#13;
I have EZP 4, I downloaded the latest svn version of addcollabrule.&#13;
According to the flash movie, I created a new workflow 'add collaboration rule'&#13;
but as you can see on my screenshot : http://img70.imageshack.us/img70/1131/67325094xf4.jpg&#13;
I don't have the same as the flash movie : http://img234.imageshack.us/img234/4652/15448556ui2.jpg : "membership approval" box isn't here.&#13;
Then I choose 'publish after' in triggers section.&#13;
&#13;
When a new user is registering, he can straight after view the member section. How can I (admin) approve (or not) his membership before ?&#13;
&#13;
Thank you.</description>

      <description>Hi Xavier&#13;
&#13;
The problem here is that I think that we should give the user a choice, but the current workflow event doesn't handle this. For new forum replies we also need to use the parent (forum topic) instead of the reply to add subtree notification rules for.&#13;
&#13;
Any suggestions on how to do this?</description>

      <description>Hi, Great news.&#13;
&#13;
Is this going to be added here on these forums ?&#13;

      <description>Hi Xavier&#13;
&#13;
This extension handles collaboration rules, not subtree notification rules.&#13;
&#13;
Maybe the following extension is closer to what you're looking for: http://ez.no/community/contribs/workflow/sck_cen_create_subtree_notification_rule. Options for creator and owner were added this week in svn, so that would cover A.&#13;
&#13;
Concerning B: a similar workflow event on the membership post register trigger could do this, but we need to add another algorithm to get the node to add notification rules for (the project, not the user group we're joining). Just going up in the tree until we find a project should work.&#13;
&#13;
Ideally, the user should have a way to choose if he wants to get those subtree notifications automatically added or not. The mentioned workflow event type currently does not have some way to do this, but maybe we can handle this with a user preference?</description>

      <description>Hi,&#13;
&#13;
It would be nice to be able to extend that to add by default notifications when publishing something.&#13;
&#13;
Case usage:&#13;
&#13;
A) I create a new post, I'm automatically having a notification on it.&#13;
B) I ask for membership on a project, I'm having notifications on it (new articles, forums...)&#13;
&#13;
What do you think ?&#13;
