      <title>Re: How much can you save?</title>

      <description>There is no decrease in net data volume since base64-encoding only uses 6 bits per character. But the big save is in round-trip time due to fewer number of HTTP-requests. If you count the overhead in headers for each HTTP-request you also save some bytes of data there.&#13;
Off course the resulting combined CSS-file is slightly larger but it compresses well and can be cached.&#13;
&#13;
On the website I'm building now we almost halved the number of HTTP-request from ~ 56 to 30 since a lot of the images were small icons less than 2 kB in size.&#13;

      <description>Hi Johan,&#13;
&#13;
Great idea, and I look forward to trying it out.  I think it would be helpful to post some extra info about the outcome of this extension (ie, reduce filesize/bandwith) or links to extra info about Data URLs, for those who don't know what this extension does.&#13;
&#13;
One caveat with Data URLs seems to be that you only get the savings on filesize if you use gzip/deflate the CSS+ImageData on the server.  I see that you can set the max filesize in settings file - what savings have you experienced?  Would be good to put this sort of info in the main documentation too!&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;
