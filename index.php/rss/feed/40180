      <description>XROW has developed an commercial extension for Trados.&#13;

&#13;
I think it does translationmanagment with xml files.</description>

      <description>Got some info from the translator guy...&#13;
&#13;
It seems like most CAT tools just "stupidly" replace the source text with the translation. They are not able to handle something complex as the .ts format.&#13;
But still, using the .ts format is possible if we output the source text both inside &lt;source&gt; and &lt;translation&gt; tags. Then the CAT tool can be setup to translate only the text that's inside the &lt;translation&gt; tag and that should do it.&#13;
&#13;
We'll give this a try...</description>

      <title>implementation of an xml based object translation</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/eztranslationtools/forum/general/implementation_of_an_xml_based_object_translation</link>
      <description>I'll start working on the translation of eZP objects based on the xml translation file. The idea for this feature came from a translator that is currently translating an eZP site. So it's a real life need and I have a translator that is willing to participate in this project by testing and giving ideas.&#13;
&#13;
The idea for the translation workflow goes like this:&#13;
&#13;
- site administrator or editor generates an xml translation file from the text stored in eZP objects and download it&#13;
- the translator translates this file using a CAT tool&#13;
- the site admin/editor uploads this translated file and runs the script which translates all the eZP objects using this translated xml file&#13;
&#13;
This would be the schema:&#13;
&#13;
http://project.studioartlan.com/pub/images/translation%20schema.png&#13;
&#13;
For now there are no constraints on the format of the xml file, so I suggested to use the linguist translation format (.ts) that is already used by eZP (in the future, support for other formats might be implemented). I'm waiting to hear comments about this from the tranlsator.&#13;
&#13;
Any thoughts or ideas about this?&#13;

&#13;
One idea is to make the extension pluggable and configurable so that it can use many different translation tools. For example both v1 and v2 of google translate apis and other services for realtime translation. And also support different translation file formats for background translation, so that you can upload the translation file made by your preffered CAT tool.&#13;
&#13;
If you have any suggestions or ideas how to integrate some crowdin's functionality into eztranslationtools, feel free to come forward.</description>

      <description>Hi guys, and thanks for starting such a discussion.&#13;
&#13;
Please keep in mind that one of the tools i am very much considering for translation is the online, TS-enabled http://crowdin.net platform.&#13;
&#13;
I wish to use this when it comes to the actual translation work, since it does not imply any prior technical knowledge (SVN, or GIT now). This is meant to both ease and increase the contribution to Internationalizing eZ Publish.&#13;
&#13;
My 2 cents to help you move-on,&#13;
Keep-up,&#13;

&gt;&gt; P.S.2 Just another idea that came up now. Caching of translation results would be a good idea. So that we don't have to call google apis several times for the same terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[Lukasz]&#13;
&gt; I think your proposal is fine but there is another way using the current version of the object to be translated, thus creating an object in another language?&#13;
&#13;
[Marko]&#13;
Well the caching I was referring  to is just caching of the translated words/phrases in a cache file and has nothing to do with eZ objects and translations. It's just simple file caching of terms that were already translated that can later be reused in translating many objects without having to call the google apis again for the cached terms.&#13;
This could even be a more "permanent" cache than standard eZ cache (think of storage folder), so that it doesn't get cleared when deleting eZ cache. </description>

      <description>Reply from Marko:&#13;
&#13;
I suggest we implement both google translation apis and make it configurable via INI so that the user/developer can decide what to use. Also make it configurable in such a way so that it can easily be extended to use other translation services as well. Or even to define a custom class and method to handle translation.&#13;
&#13;
Also there's one more thing we should decide. Wether to extend the eztranslationtools extension or make a completely new extension (eztranslator for example)?&#13;
Gaetano, this is your call.&#13;

      <description>Reply from Lukasz Klejmberg:&#13;
&#13;
Ok, i think that we can make a GUI interface for editors and maybe for frontend user we can add possibility to use translate when he writes someting on forum, posts, comments?&#13;
&#13;
maybe it will be good idea when we can add possibility for developers who wants to translate some nodes, trees at one click/shell command, for example using cli scripts or from backend?&#13;
&#13;
In my extension i used asynchronous method using google api (PHP) but now i don't know wheter it was a good idea?&#13;
&#13;
here is the latest api:&#13;
http://code.google.com/intl/pl/apis/language/translate/v2/getting_started.html&#13;
&#13;
but the grauded api is here:&#13;
http://code.google.com/intl/pl/apis/language/translate/v1/getting_started.html&#13;
&#13;
on what version we could resist solution, how do you think? </description>

      <description>Reply from Marko:&#13;
&#13;
My suggestion is to join forces and gather it all up in one extensions. We can make it layered so that contains:&#13;
&#13;
 - GUI interface for editors/translators to use&#13;
 - shell scripts and tools for administrators&#13;
 - APIs for devlopers who want to extend the usage even more&#13;
&#13;
It should be configurable which translation service it uses (so that it can be extended to more than just google translate), and also have the possibility to use custom translate functions (if someone wants to use his own translation library).&#13;
&#13;
So what do you say that we gather it all up in a complete eZP translation extension?&#13;

      <description>Reply from Gateano:&#13;
&#13;
About google translation: I already did an extension for that: http://projects.ez.no/ezgoogletranslate&#13;
The interface is rudimentary at the moment, and the code is in svn only (never released version 0.1)&#13;
You are welcome to apply as participant and hack on it all day and all night. Kudos if you get funding for that.&#13;
&#13;
Note that there is also another extension about google translation: google_translate_in_backend.&#13;
I once told the author of that extension that we could collaborate together. He sent me his code, and I never found the time to analyze it to see if it was fit for inclusion in mt extension. Shame on me (sorry lukasz)!&#13;
&#13;
About adding GUI interface to eztranslationtools: I am not really sure this is what I envisioned - as the 'tools' name implies, it should be something more of a collection of scripts for the developer / sysadmin.&#13;
&#13;
About using a translation source that is a phrasebook: that could be a good idea. But where to put it?&#13;
a) in a separate extension of its own&#13;
b) in ezgoogletranslate, as separate data source&#13;
c) in eztstools&#13;
&#13;
choice a is not optimal because of extension proliferation, plus we'd not be able to reuse code from the other two extensions&#13;
choice b is not optimal because we could need some code from eztstools&#13;
choice c is not optimal because of this 'no gui' principle, plus we'd need some code from ezgoogletranslate&#13;
&#13;
Any comments are welcome - in fact&#13;
. I am ccing two people that might be interested in this&#13;
. I propose we move this thread to a discussion in the extension's own forum (and maybe post a ping in the translators forum, too) </description>

      <description>Original message from Marko Žmak:&#13;
&#13;
Hi.&#13;
&#13;
I see that eztranslationtools is work in progres so I wonder if you would be interested in the following functionality:&#13;
&#13;
1) When translating content into another language in eZP you get the translation form which is prefilled with the content in original language.&#13;
This extension would first translate that content using a translation file of common words  and phrasses, and then fill the translation form with the translated content&#13;
&#13;
2) Create a php script that would be run from shell and would translate all the desired content objects automatically without user intervention, using the tanslation file.&#13;
&#13;
3) Use google translate apis to suggest a translation when translating content objects.&#13;
&#13;
I have a potential client that needs such functionality (he needs the first one and I will suggest the second and third), so instead of doing a separate extension I tough that joining forces with you would be a better idea.&#13;
&#13;
Are you interested?&#13;
