      <title>Mirror of the ez_projects extension repository on GitHub!</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/ez_projects/forum/general/mirror_of_the_ez_projects_extension_repository_on_github</link>
      <description>Hello eZ Community using ez_projects extension repository!&#13;
&#13;
Brookins Consulting is happy to announce we have created a complete mirror import of the project's svn repository into a git based repository on GitHub.&#13;
&#13;
https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/projects.ez.no&#13;
&#13;
We continue strive to keep this friendly fork / mirror up to date with any changes that come in the future from the forums and other forks in an effort to remain compatible with the latest versions of eZ Publish.&#13;
&#13;
Anyone is free to use (clone) this repository, just watch it for changes, or fork this new repository and use it as needed freely. Again, this is a friendly mirror of the extension repository.&#13;
&#13;
Currently the latest version provided by the mirror is r76 | Nicolas Pastorino | 2013-05-15 2:20pm.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;
Brookins Consulting&#13;

      <description>@nico:&#13;
&#13;
- for xml, i was thinking to have something along these lines:&#13;
1. rss feeds for stuff that canges (latest comments, commits, reviews)&#13;
2. an xml view for stuff that changes little (description, contributors)&#13;
&#13;
The xml you propose is fine, I just hope you build it via templates ;-). Could the url be slightly tweaked so that if want to export other stuff (releases, etc...) it would still make sense?&#13;
&#13;
- for the archive, the fastest I can think of is to use wget or httrack (or similar) to just grab html pages + zips and dump them as static stuff on a vhost/subdirectory somewhere.&#13;
Some quick + dirty php script might be used to clean up the 'add comment' button and other dead stuff.&#13;
I am sure extracting data from the eZ db is a better option, but it will actually take more time...</description>

      <description>@gaetano : the archive thing could be an option indeed. We do not want to lose any of the ideas and concepts from the contribs section. How would you see this ?&#13;
&#13;
Per the export : RSS is not sufficient for what we wanted to do on share.ez.no. Here is the kind of digest information we needed : &#13;
http://projects.ez.no/projectexport/export/cjw_newsletter/1&#13;
&#13;
Which leads to this, once imported on share.ez.no : http://share.ez.no/new/projects/cjw-newsletter&#13;
&#13;
We felt this exported view would be helpful for anybody to reflect projects on their platform, hence this thread. &#13;
Obviously this is a first version, and enhancements should be brought on-demand !&#13;
&#13;

      <description> @nicio: I think most of the projects on the old section in ez.no will not migrate by themselves, with the authors not being available or interested any more.&#13;
&#13;
But we do not want to loose all of that info, be it code or ideas.&#13;
&#13;
We should think about automated migration in a kind of 'archive' mode of all projects whose maintainers take no action within the 2 months span.</description>

      <description>The first thing to do is change the link in ez.no-&gt;developer-&gt;projects and contributions to point projects.ez.no and keep ez.no/developer/contribs for a while, then send the email notification for contribs owner.&#13;
&#13;
Backing to the topic question, I can't say if creating some type of xml communication between share and projects is a good idea because I don't know what is the long term plan to both sites, I don't know if the plan is merge share and projects into one bigger site or just improve communication between them.&#13;
&#13;
I know that already has some type of integration in http://share.ez.no/new/projects but a point that I don't like is that in the share site there's a forum to ask about extensions, and in projects there's another. In share there's also a translation forum, and in projects there's the translation projects wich has a forum, I think this redundance isn't necessary, and would be better just one place to post comments and foum posts. Analysing ez.no and share I realized that projects.ez.no is a kind of hidden site, and people prefer use share ( wich is a little hidden too in ez.no ) to posts comment and ask for help about some project in projects.ez.no</description>

      <description>Good point Thiago. &#13;
This has been planned for a while now but never was realized. I would be wise to indeed do this before doing the full-merger of share </description>

      <title>XML view of a given project</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/ez_projects/forum/suggestions/xml_view_of_a_given_project</link>
      <description>Hi, &#13;
&#13;
In the process of getting share.ez.no and projects.ez.no closer (merged eventually), a first step would be to make available to the outter world a XML view of a given project. This would allow anybody to get updated information about a given project he/she is participating to (latest forum activity, members, leaders, reviews ), and potentially display this information somewhere else.&#13;
&#13;
What do you guys think ?&#13;

      <title>[Solved] SVN: can't commit</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/ez_projects/forum/general/solved_svn_can_t_commit</link>
      <description>basically, see http://ez.no/developer/forum/developer/support_needed_svn_on_projects_ez_no_can_t_commit ;)&#13;
I registered my first project here (hr_highslide), but i am not able to commit via SVN.&#13;
It seems as my SVN account does not exist or the password, that I use on all ez.no websites is not accepted in SVN.&#13;
Can somebody please check my SVN account. My username on *.ez.no is "marco".&#13;
&#13;
Thanks.&#13;
&#13;
EDIT:&#13;
Solved...&#13;
The issue was a wrong username. My username seems to be "Marco", not "marco". It seems, as SVN is very case-sensitivy, while ez.no sites seem to be more tolerant: I always log in with "marco"...</description>

It would be very nice if the user's profile page [0]&#13;

Displayed the total number of projects lead by the user&#13;

Or perhaps the total number of projects created by the user.&#13;

      <description>While viewvc would be nice 'option' to have available [0] to projects.ez.no users. (really viewvc is just not the useful too most projects.ez.no leaders are hoping view since it's still limited greatly)&#13;

Still another tool would be more useful to use (never would happen; re: Ze not invented here syndrome) or borrow (more possible) ideas to implement from [1,2] woud be Trac&#13;

I submit to you the reader a confirmed report of authenticated user being unable to create comments on news articles regardless of any -enable-comments- toggle or switch.&#13;

It is simply not possible for normal authenticated, project leaders to create comments on news items.&#13;

      <description>No,&#13;
&#13;
I can confirm as a project leader myself&#13;
that regardless of the position of the toggle&#13;
for comments on or off, logged in or not no&#13;
one is able to publish comments on this site.&#13;
&#13;
Test this for your self. I just did with the cie&#13;
project news item and failed to be able to&#13;
publish comments.&#13;
&#13;
Then look at past news, notice no one is&#13;
placing comments. Is this not strange to&#13;
anyone else?&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <description>Right now comments on different projects are too hidden away.&#13;
Project admins are not automatically subscribed to be notified on forum posts on their own projects, and given the low traffic on per-project forums, it would be nice to have a global resume of forum posts...</description>

      <description>Hi Kracker,&#13;
&#13;
&lt;code&gt;&#13;
I wanted to ask if the mod_ezclustered_image project would continue to serve older vs current versions of eZ Publish or if this method was considered deprecated in favor of another solution? &#13;
&lt;/code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
mod_ezclustered_image will continue to serve older and new versions of eZ Publish cluster.&#13;
There is no other solution.&#13;
&#13;
I decided to stop maintaining it for the following reasons :&#13;
1. lack of time (to write an Apache module takes a lot of time)&#13;
2. difficulty to make it easily installable&#13;
3. (related to point 2) can not be compiled easily on Debian due to a too old version of one package which contains the library I need. And this is not the lastest version of this library on Debian stable. This forces users to compile their own Apache 2 instance, which is not the Debian way.&#13;
4. I do not have time to recreate a new Debian package which would fix the issue described above.&#13;
&#13;
For at least those 4 reasons I decided to stop maintaining this project.&#13;
&#13;
If you are interested in taking over it, feel free to contact me ;)&#13;
&#13;
Cheers.&#13;

comments are enabled for the news but I can not post a comment either.&#13;

      <description>For every news item posted, the poster can decide whether comments are allowed or not. I guess Jerome forgot to enable comments this time around.&#13;

I agree that the text inviting to log in for adding comments is a bit misleading...</description>

      <title>Unable to create comments on projects.ez.no news items?</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/ez_projects/forum/general/unable_to_create_comments_on_projects_ez_no_news_items</link>
      <description>Hello,&#13;
&#13;
I was reading a bit of news on projects.ez.no just at the moment and I noticed an news article [0] and I realized I wanted to reply to the article with a comment [1] but could not. I logged in both on projects.ez.no and ez.no and refreshed the page ... yet the page did not display the authenticated user with a comment form at the bottom of the article.&#13;
&#13;
I found this behavior confusing when the very page viewed as anonymous user displays text encouraging users to authenticate to comment and when the user does so they still can not create a comment? That's not right, I wonder why it's doing that?&#13;
&#13;
Perhaps, I've done something wrong and this issue is merely a side affect unexplained that only affects me I don't know. I hope this helps.&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;

      <description>Hello Kristof,&#13;
&#13;
Thank you for identifying the key available extensions used to create the features of eZ Projects. As well as identifying the subversion repository code.&#13;
&#13;
Perhaps someone will make an effort to create a new design in the future which does not have those restrictions.&#13;

      <description>Hi&#13;
&#13;
eZ Projects itself is mainly constructed with the following extensions:&#13;
http://projects.ez.no/addcollabrule&#13;
http://projects.ez.no/unixname&#13;
http://projects.ez.no/ezssp&#13;
http://projects.ez.no/autorss&#13;
http://projects.ez.no/membership__1&#13;
http://projects.ez.no/ezsubtreerelationfilter&#13;
http://projects.ez.no/ezrating&#13;
http://projects.ez.no/redirect&#13;
&#13;
There is a little bit of custom code, to initiate the Subversion repositories. This might be made available in a separate extension as well after it's a bit more generalized.&#13;
&#13;
If I remember well we are not able to share the design, due to some license restrictions (it was made long ago by a third party for the ez.no website).</description>

      <description>For many operations like viewing recent change log and viewing line by line differences of recent changes websvn1 is simpler and eZ'ier to use than websvn2 which lacks these features.&#13;
&#13;
I vote for keeping websvn1 links and adding websvn2 links as a scondary option.&#13;
