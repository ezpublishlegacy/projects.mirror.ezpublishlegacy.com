      <description>Hi,&#13;
&#13;
The problem is with a new security feature in flash 10.&#13;
&#13;
There is a fix to swfupload, the js/flash library that flashupload uses. It is detailed here:&#13;
&#13;
http://codetunes.com/2008/10/21/swfupload-and-flash-10/&#13;
&#13;
This will need integrating into flashupload.&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately I don't have the time to support this extension at the moment.&#13;
&#13;
If you or anyone else would like to take it on, you are more than welcome.&#13;
&#13;
Sorry I can't help more.</description>

      <description>Hi I seem to be experiencing trouble using this extension, I suspect it may be something to do with my server environment since I've tried it on 2 separate ezp installations.  The flash loads fine, the upload progress bars work fine, however after the first file finishes uploading the page prematurely reloads before the other files are uploaded.  I then don't find that no files were really been upload.  The debug output doesn't seem really helpful:&#13;

&lt;/code&gt;&#13;
&#13;
If I visit /flashupload/upload/185 directly I get this message, Warning: Call-time pass-by-reference has been deprecated - argument passed by value; If you would like to pass it by reference, modify the declaration of [runtime function name](). If you would like to enable call-time pass-by-reference, you can set allow_call_time_pass_reference to true in your INI file. However, future versions may not support this any longer. in /data/www/mydomain/extension/flashupload/modules/flashupload/upload.php on line 46&#13;
&#13;
I tried enabling the php allow_call_time_pass_reference but this didn't help.  I would really appreciate any advice on tracking my problem down.&#13;
