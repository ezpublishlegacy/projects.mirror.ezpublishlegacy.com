      <description>Hi Brendan,&#13;
&#13;
we're using Wowza Media Server with RTMP Steaming and JW Player to display the content. &#13;
&#13;
The JW player also supports bandwith detection and switching:&#13;
&#13;
Examples:&#13;
http://www.all2e.com/Showcase/Streaming-Video-mit-eZ-Publish&#13;
http://www.musikmachen.de/Lernen/Workshops/Videoworkshop-Lick-of-the-Week-Open-String-Scales&#13;
&#13;
To convert the input files to a valid streaming format we made a datatype which uses an external service to convert the videos. So there's no problem with user-generated content and the different formats.</description>

      <description>I hope you manage to get the live stream support done as I'm hoping to use this as a part of a project I'm working on.&#13;
&#13;
It looks like Red5 is getting live stream support now too, check the features in Red5 0.9.0.&#13;
http://red5.googlecode.com/svn/doc/trunk/changelog.txt&#13;
&#13;
I don't think it will be too hard to get dvswitch to stream to either Red5 or Wowza, I couldn't see a way to get Icecast to live stream to an embedded flash player so I changed focus and will play with Red5 soon.&#13;
&#13;
I'll keep an eye on the improved eZmedia project, could be fruitful.&#13;
&#13;
If I manage to make some progress I'll let you know how I get on.</description>

      <description>Thanks Brendan&#13;
The live stream feature is not fully implemented yet. But im working on it. I have worked mostly with Windows media and Apple live streams earlier, so flash is new to me. Will test it against wowza streaming server.&#13;
&#13;
Dvswitch was a really cool thing, been playing a little with it here myself now. Great find! This might get usefull. You should be able to pickup the stream and send it to a flash streaming server, i'll let you know if i get it to work. &#13;
I am considering if i should use the ezflowplayer code and making it a streaming product to support several other formats. I know ezmedia supports several formats, but they dont support proper streaming servers. That was the reason i started with flowplayer. &#13;
Wowza will support apple, windows and flash in the next version. Will consider icecast also if i go that way. Maybe we can get it to support several live streams at the same time:) &#13;
&#13;
A while back i did a open funding project to write a spec for a better media support for eZ. Maybe its time to go further on that now..http://ez.no/developer/open_funding/suggestions_for_new_functionality/ez_media_improvements</description>

      <description>Hi Pål&#13;
&#13;
Thanks for the great extension.  I'm considering using it for displaying a live stream which I will be generating from a Debian machine using DVSwitch http://dvswitch.alioth.debian.org and I was wondering if you have any experience or advice with live streams?&#13;
&#13;
I've only just started to research what I'll need to do this, initially I was intending to use ffmpeg2theora to convert my output then point it at an icecast server, but it doesn't appear that Flowplayer is yet able to support theora streams.&#13;
&#13;
Any ideas for me?&#13;
&#13;
Thanks</description>

      <description>Got some plans for several different templates here. One of them are play lists. From there we can get a recommendations screen, maybe we can use relation functions within eZ to fix it.</description>

      <description>Hi :)&#13;
&#13;
It looks very good! I can't wait for it. :)&#13;
&#13;
If possible, the "recommendations screen" after viewing a movie is nice, using maybe an xml listing all previously uploaded movies. I think Flow player supports it.&#13;
&#13;
