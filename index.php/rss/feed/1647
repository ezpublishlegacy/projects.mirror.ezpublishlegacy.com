      <title>Mirror of ezpersistentobjectgenerator repository on GitHub!</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/ezpersistentobject_generator/forum/general/mirror_of_ezpersistentobjectgenerator_repository_on_github</link>
      <description>Hello eZ Community using ezpersistentobject_generator extension!&#13;
&#13;
Brookins Consulting is happy to announce we have created a full and complete import of the entire project's svn repository into a git based repository on GitHub.&#13;
&#13;
https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/ezpersistentobjectgenerator&#13;
&#13;
We will strive to keep this friendly fork / mirror up to date with any changes that come in the future from the forums and other forks in an effort to remain compatible with the latest versions of eZ Publish.&#13;
&#13;
Anyone is free to use (clone) this repository, just watch it for changes, or fork this new repository and use it as needed freely. This is a friendly mirror of the extension.&#13;
&#13;
Currently the latest version provided by the mirror is r10 | Cyberwolf | 2008-12-09 02:30:05 -0600 (Tue, 09 Dec 2008).&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;
Brookins Consulting&#13;

      <title>Suggestions for additions to instructions</title>

      <description>Hi Kristof,&#13;
&#13;
You might want to add the following to the project details:&#13;
&#13;
1. The script requires that your eZ Publish database user has access to the 'information_schema' database, which might not be the case with your web host. That means that you should probably make use of the script in a local development environment where you have total control. NOTE: As of now, the script will not throw any error message to warn you if the DB user has limited access.&#13;
&#13;
2. When running the script locally, you might get a MySQL connection warning if your server is set to "localhost". If so, try changing it to "127.0.0.1".&#13;
&#13;
3. When the ezpersisent sub class has been generated, it will be placed in "var/cache/phpcreator/"</description>
