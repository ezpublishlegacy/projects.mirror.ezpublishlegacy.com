      <description>Hi Lars Eirik,&#13;
&#13;
&gt; issue 1: Does this mean you have not tried the same scenario as i have mentioned,&#13;
&gt; or have you verified that the before mentioned scenario actually works on your installation?&#13;
&#13;
I have not tried it.&#13;
&#13;
&gt; Before i spend time looking into the database mapping and tables , i would like to know&#13;
&gt; if there is any point in doing so. Also would you be able to provide me with a brief hint&#13;
&gt; on which tables to check? &#13;
&#13;
You mean you want me to troubleshoot your problem for you in addition to writing and sharing the application? ;)</description>

      <description>Hi Lars Eirik,&#13;
&#13;
Thanks for trying out ezclasspec/nmcontentclass, and for your feedback.&#13;
&#13;
Issue no. 1: I have not experienced this issue, but suspect it is related to the version number on the attribute not matching up with the ones of the objects you are editing. Could you take a look at the database and see if there are any differences in versions of the attributes in the content objects that display the additional attributes, and those that don't?&#13;
&#13;
Issue no. 2: As stated in the docs for eZ Class Spec:&#13;
&#13;
"[...] the specification only needs to include the changes you would like to&#13;
make to the classes, and not the entire class structure. For instance, if you want to &#13;
make changes to, or a new attribute to an existing class, the class specification only &#13;
needs to include that specific attribute, and its current data."&#13;
&#13;
This means that if a class spec is missing an attribute, it's assumed to have been added manually through the admin interface, and hence does not tamper with it. This behaviour could of course be modified, either to support a flag which would consider the class spec to be complete, or to keep a backlog of deleted attributes, but that's not very high on our list of priorities. However, I'd be happy to give you member privelieges to the project if you would like to contribute. It should be a fairly easy fix.</description>

      <title>Great utility</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/nmcontentclass/forum/general/great_utility</link>
      <description>Hi. It seems to be working as expected for creating new attributes and new contentclasses if starting on a new project.&#13;
I have tested this a bit now and i experience some issues which you hopefully will fix.&#13;
I created a spec file using your other utility and imported this into ezpublish with nmcontentclass module.&#13;
&#13;
The new attributes are added to a new class and when i create an object this works fine.&#13;
If i do modifications to this spec , that is add a new attribute or alter the name of the attribute this is reflected in the existing class&#13;
&#13;
1:The major drawback to me is that whenever i edit an existing object the recent modifications to the class are not taken into consideration. In my case my object only give me the option of adding/editing the content of the two inital attributes. Looking at the class however i can clearly see that there should be more attributes available. &#13;
Have you experienced this as well? , is this perhaps not just fully implemented (i know its a beta release). Because at present time, this tool cannot be used on an existing installation where you have existing attributes. Please correct me if there is something with my installation here..&#13;
&#13;
2: The class it self is not updated if i decide to remove an existing attribute and reimport the spec file. It says "Not action needs to be taken"&#13;
&#13;
Update1: New objects do get the expected attributes as found in the content class overview, but as mentioned earlier the older objects do not.&#13;
&#13;
Any thoughts or response to this is greatly appreciated as the combination of the spec and the import module in ezpublish is something which should have been an integral part of the eZPublish content management system.. It is rather frustrating to have to use different non-stable solutions in order to not have to redo lots of work for you clients.&#13;
Thanks for creating this great tool guys.&#13;
Hope you have the time to work on this further down the line.&#13;
