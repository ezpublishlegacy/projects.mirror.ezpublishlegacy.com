      <title>Mirror of the swark extension on GitHub!</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/swark_for_ez_publish_4/forum/general/mirror_of_the_swark_extension_on_github</link>
      <description>Hello eZ Community using swark extension!&#13;
&#13;
Brookins Consulting is happy to announce we have created a complete mirror import of the project's extension download sources (for eZ Publish 3.x, 4.x and 5.x) into a git based repository on GitHub.&#13;
&#13;
https://github.com/brookinsconsulting/swark&#13;
&#13;
We will strive to keep this friendly fork / mirror up to date with any changes that come in the future from the forums and other forks in an effort to remain compatible with the latest versions of eZ Publish.&#13;
&#13;
Anyone is free to use (clone) this repository, just watch it for changes, or fork this new repository and use it as needed freely. This is a friendly mirror of the extension.&#13;
&#13;
Currently the latest version provided by the mirror is from Apr 2, 2012 and will work with the latest version of eZ Publish (Legacy Stack).&#13;
&#13;
Documentation of the swark extension can be found here: http://www.seeds.no/eng/ez-publish/downloads/swark/swark-documentation&#13;
&#13;
Cheers,&#13;
Brookins Consulting&#13;

      <title>Swark extension for eZ Publish 3.x</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/swark_for_ez_publish_4/forum/general/swark_extension_for_ez_publish_3_x</link>
      <description>The package of the Swark extension available for download within this project's downloads is the original 1.0.0 release for eZ Publish 4.x&#13;
&#13;
If you wish to use the Swark extension for eZ Publish 4.x or greater then please download the latest version which is properly eZ Publish 4.x compatible directly from the author's website.&#13;
&#13;
http://seeds.no/eng/ez-publish/downloads/swark-for-ez-publish-4&#13;
&#13;
If you wish to use the Swark extension for eZ Publish 3.x &gt;= 3.10.x then please download the latest version which is properly eZ Publish 3.x compatible directly from the author's website.&#13;
&#13;
http://seeds.no/eng/ez-publish/downloads/swark&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Update: I also found that this extension for eZ Publish 3.x is also available in a separate project, http://projects.ez.no/swark&#13;
&#13;
Note: It is a good idea to mention that the 3.x and 4.x packages seems to be identical (at a glance) to the packages available for download from the author's website. I would recommend downloading your own copy using the author's website, as this seems to be maintained while this project is clearly not maintained any longer (also it is a project imported from the older ez.no contributions section, and these seem to have remained unmaintained since long before the migration).&#13;
&#13;
I hope this helps other users looking to obtain the features this extension provides in a very simple to use all in one solution.&#13;
&#13;
If you have a few minutes, take a look at the author's other impressive extensions available (note some of these are -not- available on projects.ez.no at all! So they may not be publicly distributed forever, get yourself your own copies so if they ever take them down you will have your own personal copies which you can continue to use as needed), I think you might find some new functionality you may have an interest in trying to use yourself. Enjoy!&#13;
