      <title>Nice idea</title>
      <link>http://projects.ez.no/abpdfcatalogue/reviews/nice_idea</link>
      <description>This is a neat bit of programming. &#13;
&#13;
My only reservation is it seems that maybe you are falling into the 'solution looking for a problem' trap. Programmers are great at coming up with clever systems, but often not so good at getting the end users enthusiastic about their great ideas. Without a few real world examples it's a bit hard for editors or users to see the potential of your extension. &#13;
&#13;
Here's a couple of ideas: &#13;
&#13;
If one were to develop a website to support a cookbook your extension could be utilised to allow visitors to drag off and print a selection of recipes. I'm not sure about others, but I much prefer to use a throwaway printout of a recipe in my rather messy kitchen than an expensive cookbook. You could, of course, use eZ user registration to only allow people who had bought the book access.&#13;
&#13;
A conference organiser with a bunch of speakers presenting papers could let attendees download a selection of papers.&#13;
&#13;
An academic running a personal website of self-published papers could offer and easy way of printing off a selection of their work. (I have a client in who fits into this category, and she loves eZ Publish - the only thing she'd really love would be a well implemented footnoting/citation extension).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Hope that helps&#13;
